You had to be able to lift the 120 pound rock if you wanted to be an oarsman.\n\nAfter our hike we ate a picnic lunch at one of the picnic tables near the parking lot.\n\nNext up was Arnastapi and statue of Bárdur Snaefellsás, the giant troll man. By this time the youngest ones had had enough touring and were in need of some play time, luckily there was a small playground that was perfect for the situation.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/b00df20ae4.png \"The troll\")\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/208448d1df.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/ce013018d8.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/606564128e.png \"The big kids at the playground\")\n\nAlthough there was a real need for some nap time, and yes, by this time it was way past nap time. We had one last stop for the day at **Ytri Tunga Beach** The main attraction here was to see some seals.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/15fe540650.png)\n\nThe weather at the beach was really windy, but we did see some seals, so mission accomplished! We had just under an hour to drive back home and it was very quiet in the van.\n\nDinner this evening was a smorgasbord of what we had leftover for groceries, Icelandic hotdogs, French friends from the fish and chips a few nights ago, and even a few pieces of fish, not to mention the Mac and Cheese that Nana brought with. \n\nNext stop, a short night in Reykjavík and an early morning flight back to Minneapolis.\n\n\n",

In Iceland one of those things is glacial flooding. It happens fairly frequently when water builds up and suddenly explodes out of the glacier. This happened the day before we flew to Iceland, and it closed a section of the ring road. The ring road is a pretty important road around the island, and in fact in many cases the only way to get from point A to point B.

For others who were not so lucky, they needed to drive more than 14 or more hours out of their way to get to the airport or to get to their hotel!

Just a little work with an ice pick.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/ant07590.png \"Fixing the trail\")\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/ant07580.png)\n\nAfter returning to the house I started the spaghetti for supper and Tanner and Johannes headed to the lava show. We also tried it the sauna and hot tub on the deck. This house is so amazing views of the ocean out one window glaciers and horses out the other!\n\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>The plan for our first full day in Carvoeiro (pronounced curve-way-go) was to go sea kayaking through the amazing Benagil sea caves! When we arrived on the corner where we supposed to meet our guide we were a bit early, and nobody else was there yet. Eventually our guide came, long hair, rings on every finger, tanned, very suave. “You are going to have a great day” he said! “I just know as soon as I walk out the door what the sea is going to be like, and today is a very good day.” Another guide heading up the hill asked him, “have you had a look?” We were on the side of the second guide having driven by the landing area. He walked around the corner and returned a few minutes later, with a smile on his face and a new question for us. “Are you ready to get wet?”</p>\n<p>Personally, I’m not a huge fan of “getting wet” in the cold Atlantic waters. But I’m willing to be a good sport from time to time. This was one of those times. The next problem was my shoes. Sir, do you have sandals or flip-flops? Nope these are the only pair I brought, well you can walk barefoot down the hill and back then.</p>\n<p>So, down the hill we went, and when we got to the landing area the waves were just crashing in, coming in fairly large curls of blackish water! Our guide was undaunted, “If you trust me a little, I can get you out past the breakers and into the calmer water. We probably can’t go into any caves, but it will be fine!” Given his track record so far none of us were inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt, but nevertheless we noted a couple of kayaks going out in between the really bad waves. Suddenly the guides were all huddled around a phone staring intently, I heard the word “suspended.” And finally the guide admitted defeat. The maritime authorities have declared that all kayaking trips are cancelled this morning. I could still get you there, but you would all be breaking the law. LOL.</p>\n<p>So our day of kayaking was a bust. Even worse, none of us took a picture of the waves!!</p>\n<p>With kayaking out of the picture we headed to Carvoeiro to do the boardwalk. It was very scenic and considerably drier than the kayaks.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8331.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8326.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>After doing the boardwalk we came back and made ourselves sandwiches, and hung out at the pool, reading, dozing, and whatnot.</p>\n<p>For dinner we headed back in to Carvoeiro for dinner at an Indian restaurant called Gurkha Kitchen. It’s a Nepalese and Indian place that was very good. We / I was definitely in the mood for something a bit different than we had been eating for the last week, and this fit the bill perfectly. Papadams, some dumplings, some Nepal curry, it was great. We could have gone higher on the spice levels but we all enjoyed the food very much.</p>\n<p>This morning we woke up, took our time with coffee etc, and then headed for Sagras, it is the farthest southwest point Europe. You know this because there is a bratwurst stand that says Last Brat before America!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8348.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Unfortunately when we arrived a massive cloud bank was rolling in, and we couldn’t see anything! Also the fort was not open because the workers were on a one day strike! So it was kind of a bust. Here you see our selfie at Sagras and then another selfie just 30 miles away less then an hour later!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8352.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Sagras\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8372.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Lagos\"></p>\n<p>The second picture was taken in Lagos on Ponte do Piedade, it was so beautiful that after taking pics from above, we ended up driving into town, finding a charge point, eating lunch, and then booking a boat to take us out to see it from the water!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8366.png\" alt=\"Memories of the Gold Coast\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8388.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8406.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8413.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>By the time we finished the boat trip and walked back to the car it was nearly 5:00, so we still had a very full day despite the challenges of the morning. We headed back to the hotel, showered, rested for a bit then had a light dinner at a nearby pizza place called Mona Lisa. It was kind of funny because it was just right around the corner, but then Jane discovered that they only took cash. We were nearly out, so it was kind of like college.

				"content_text": "The plan for our first full day in Carvoeiro (pronounced curve-way-go) was to go sea kayaking through the amazing Benagil sea caves! When we arrived on the corner where we supposed to meet our guide we were a bit early, and nobody else was there yet. Eventually our guide came, long hair, rings on every finger, tanned, very suave. “You are going to have a great day” he said! “I just know as soon as I walk out the door what the sea is going to be like, and today is a very good day.” Another guide heading up the hill asked him, “have you had a look?” We were on the side of the second guide having driven by the landing area. He walked around the corner and returned a few minutes later, with a smile on his face and a new question for us. “Are you ready to get wet?”\n\nPersonally, I’m not a huge fan of “getting wet” in the cold Atlantic waters. But I’m willing to be a good sport from time to time. This was one of those times. The next problem was my shoes. Sir, do you have sandals or flip-flops? Nope these are the only pair I brought, well you can walk barefoot down the hill and back then. \n\nSo, down the hill we went, and when we got to the landing area the waves were just crashing in, coming in fairly large curls of blackish water! Our guide was undaunted, “If you trust me a little, I can get you out past the breakers and into the calmer water. We probably can’t go into any caves, but it will be fine!” Given his track record so far none of us were inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt, but nevertheless we noted a couple of kayaks going out in between the really bad waves. Suddenly the guides were all huddled around a phone staring intently, I heard the word “suspended.” And finally the guide admitted defeat. The maritime authorities have declared that all kayaking trips are cancelled this morning. I could still get you there, but you would all be breaking the law. LOL.\n\nSo our day of kayaking was a bust. Even worse, none of us took a picture of the waves!!\n\nWith kayaking out of the picture we headed to Carvoeiro to do the boardwalk. It was very scenic and considerably drier than the kayaks.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8331.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8326.png)\n\nAfter doing the boardwalk we came back and made ourselves sandwiches, and hung out at the pool, reading, dozing, and whatnot. \n\nFor dinner we headed back in to Carvoeiro for dinner at an Indian restaurant called Gurkha Kitchen. It’s a Nepalese and Indian place that was very good. We / I was definitely in the mood for something a bit different than we had been eating for the last week, and this fit the bill perfectly. Papadams, some dumplings, some Nepal curry, it was great. We could have gone higher on the spice levels but we all enjoyed the food very much.\n\nThis morning we woke up, took our time with coffee etc, and then headed for Sagras, it is the farthest southwest point Europe. You know this because there is a bratwurst stand that says Last Brat before America!\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8348.png)\n\nUnfortunately when we arrived a massive cloud bank was rolling in, and we couldn’t see anything! Also the fort was not open because the workers were on a one day strike! So it was kind of a bust. Here you see our selfie at Sagras and then another selfie just 30 miles away less then an hour later!\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8352.png \"Sagras\")\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8372.png \"Lagos\")\n\nThe second picture was taken in Lagos on Ponte do Piedade, it was so beautiful that after taking pics from above, we ended up driving into town, finding a charge point, eating lunch, and then booking a boat to take us out to see it from the water!\n\n![Memories of the Gold Coast](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8366.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8388.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8406.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8413.png)\n\nBy the time we finished the boat trip and walked back to the car it was nearly 5:00, so we still had a very full day despite the challenges of the morning. We headed back to the hotel, showered, rested for a bit then had a light dinner at a nearby pizza place called Mona Lisa. It was kind of funny because it was just right around the corner, but then Jane discovered that they only took cash. We were nearly out, so it was kind of like college. Well, we have some euros, you have some euros, and if we turn in our towels at the front desk we can get our 40 euro deposit back and have enough money to eat! It sure beat jumping in the car and driving a mile to find an ATM!\n\nAfter dinner Jane and I went to the end of the lane to enjoy a bit of sunset!\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8427.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8425.png)\n\nJust as we were about to go to bed we got the news alert. The jury was in! Would they convict Trump? We waited as the pundits did their punditry and then finally the verdicts were read. One by one, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty on all counts! A small celebration broke out and a chant of “Lock him up!” Of course, soon enough the convicted felon emerged to tell us that “it was rigged” LOL!!

All was well until we arrived in Nazare - If you haven’t watched 100 foot wave you really need to watch a couple episodes! In Nazare it was time to recharge. Using the MIIO app, it was no problem finding a station, but getting the car to charge was like a clown show! Rookies!

We walked down, but more about that later. The Peña palace is a huge sprawling complex with miles of hiking paths, castle walls, and a tour of the inside of the castle (which we skipped).

				"title": "Food Tour",
				"content_html": "<p>We started today with a short walk to meet our guide, Maria, for a food tour of Porto. Maria is a private chef and sommelier who does these tours as well. She grew up in the neighborhood of Porto that we were visiting. We made several stops during our tour so let&rsquo;s review, step by step.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Nota and coffee and Hungarian cookies. We had been waiting to try the Nota since we landed in Lisbon. But we did not want to have our first taste be something mass produced for airport visitors. This did not disappoint. The Nota is a pastry filled with egg custard. Seriously, the egg custard reminded me of my mom’s whipped cream where you could feel the sugar crunch between your teeth as you ate it. We also had a shortbread cookie that was half dipped in chocolate called a Hungarian. Both were great. Lots of pastries are made with egg yolks because the nuns who originally made the pastries used the egg whites as starch to stiffen their habits. <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-0987.png\" alt=\"\"></li>\n<li><strong>Spice store</strong> Romeo and Juliet (cheese and apple jam) At the spice store where Maria has shopped since childhood we tried the Romeo and Juliet, a slice of cheese topped with a dense slice of Quince on top. The salty cheese and the sweet marmalade were a perfect combination.</li>\n<li><strong>Market</strong> From the spice store we headed to the main market. It is a beautiful open air market, newly remodeled I think. Apparently once you have the license for a stall you can pass it on to your direct descendants, otherwise it is very hard to get in.\n<ol>\n<li>Figs with Walnuts: we started with a taste of a fig stuffed with a walnut. Pretty tasty even for me who is not a big fan of figs.</li>\n<li>Beans (lupins) and Olives: The olives were olives, enough said. (I’m not a fan) But the Lupins were really interesting. You peel off a thin shell and then eat them. The consistency and taste reminded me of a rather hard cheese, and Maria confirmed that the lupins are often used to make a vegan cheese.</li>\n<li>Oyster and Mussels: Fresh oysters and Mussels. Pretty good. Brian did the oyster on the half-shell, the rest of us mussels. Not sure I’ve had a raw mussel before, it seemed like it had been cooked and then served cold.</li>\n<li>Sardines and Cod on crackers: Ok, this one tested us a bit. Sardines were a real staple of the Porto diet, especially if you were a working class family. I really wasn’t even sure I wanted to try one, but when you are on a food tour you just do it, that’s what you are there for. I thought the sardine on a cracker was quite good. The cod was more fishy to my taste but still decent. We actually went back and bought a tin of sardines to take on the train to the Douro valley. The cod in Porto is all dried, and then reconstituted when it is time to eat it, can you say Luetefisk? <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-1002.png\" alt=\"\"> <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-1001.png\" alt=\"\"></li>\n<li>Ginja: Time for a drink!

In fact Maria said that when you are getting the black pork it is important to have the butcher cut it in front of you so that you can verify that it is the black pork.

				"content_text": "We started today with a short walk to meet our guide, Maria, for a food tour of Porto. Maria is a private chef and sommelier who does these tours as well. She grew up in the neighborhood of Porto that we were visiting. We made several stops during our tour so let's review, step by step.\n\n1. Nota and coffee and Hungarian cookies. We had been waiting to try the Nota since we landed in Lisbon. But we did not want to have our first taste be something mass produced for airport visitors. This did not disappoint. The Nota is a pastry filled with egg custard. Seriously, the egg custard reminded me of my mom’s whipped cream where you could feel the sugar crunch between your teeth as you ate it. We also had a shortbread cookie that was half dipped in chocolate called a Hungarian. Both were great. Lots of pastries are made with egg yolks because the nuns who originally made the pastries used the egg whites as starch to stiffen their habits. ![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-0987.png)\n2. **Spice store** Romeo and Juliet (cheese and apple jam) At the spice store where Maria has shopped since childhood we tried the Romeo and Juliet, a slice of cheese topped with a dense slice of Quince on top. The salty cheese and the sweet marmalade were a perfect combination.\n3. **Market** From the spice store we headed to the main market. It is a beautiful open air market, newly remodeled I think. Apparently once you have the license for a stall you can pass it on to your direct descendants, otherwise it is very hard to get in.\n\t1. Figs with Walnuts: we started with a taste of a fig stuffed with a walnut. Pretty tasty even for me who is not a big fan of figs.\n\t2. Beans (lupins) and Olives: The olives were olives, enough said. (I’m not a fan) But the Lupins were really interesting. You peel off a thin shell and then eat them. The consistency and taste reminded me of a rather hard cheese, and Maria confirmed that the lupins are often used to make a vegan cheese.\n\t3. Oyster and Mussels: Fresh oysters and Mussels. Pretty good. Brian did the oyster on the half-shell, the rest of us mussels. Not sure I’ve had a raw mussel before, it seemed like it had been cooked and then served cold.\n\t4. Sardines and Cod on crackers: Ok, this one tested us a bit. Sardines were a real staple of the Porto diet, especially if you were a working class family. I really wasn’t even sure I wanted to try one, but when you are on a food tour you just do it, that’s what you are there for. I thought the sardine on a cracker was quite good. The cod was more fishy to my taste but still decent. We actually went back and bought a tin of sardines to take on the train to the Douro valley. The cod in Porto is all dried, and then reconstituted when it is time to eat it, can you say Luetefisk? ![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-1002.png) ![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-1001.png)\n\t5. Ginja: Time for a drink! Ginja is a cherry liquor served in a chocolate cup. I’m not a huge cherry fan, but this tasted a little more like anise, or if you are in a bad mood you might say cough syrup.\n\t6. Iberian and Black pork: Although I had tried the black pork, this was our chance to see the Iberian and black pork side by side. When we tried several slices of the different pork side by side it was easy to see why the black pork is so much more expensive. 60 euros per kg for the Iberian, and 180 euros per kg for the black.

Bread: We tried the peasant bread made with malt, barley and wheat flour. It was a very dark bread, and tasted like it had molasses in it, but that is just the malt. It lasts for a couple of weeks, and then you use it in bread pudding.\n\t8. Bonus Ginja: as we were leaving the market another tour guide came up to us with a tray of Ginja — We didn’t use it all with our group, please enjoy another glass! ![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-1004.png)\n4.

We had an extremely aggressive hiking plan for today and immediately realized we had to tone it down. So we opted for the Levada das 25 Fontes. A levada is an irrigation channel or aqueduct specific to the Portuguese Atlantic region of Madeira. Basically they are small channels designed to bring the rain water from the upper elevations to the region around Funchal and other areas that need the water.

The usual way to the start of the hike was just a boring walk downhill on a very narrow road. So this way was much better and more interesting. But by then we were pretty tired from the long rough descent, so we only did a small part of the original hike.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8133.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Waterfalls\"></p>\n<p>By the time we finished it was 2:00 in the afternoon and we hadn’t really eaten anything other than a few snacks.

Brian had Scabbard fish, Jane had baked Octopus, I had Portuguese black pork and Holly had Tuna steak. All deliciously prepared over an open fire. We all shared and all the dishes were really good.</p>\n<p>By the time we got back to our AirBNB we were ready for showers and then happy hour. At happy hour we tried the Poncha and some Portuguese green wine, and a cheese plate. We played a game of Qwirkle at another local establishment and called it a night at 10pm!

We had to go see the statue of Cristiano Ronaldo to see if it was as bad as it was in the pictures!\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8101.png \"CR7\")\n\nIt was… Next ask yourself the question, why is his crotch extra shiny?? There is so much to do in Funchal, that I can already see we could have spent a week here easily. We did try the Madeira wine as we were walking around. Just eating our way through all the local places could take more than a week.\n\nWe all made it past 9pm! Today we woke up around 7am local time. 1AM CDT. We had an extremely aggressive hiking plan for today and immediately realized we had to tone it down. So we opted for the Levada das 25 Fontes. A levada is an irrigation channel or aqueduct specific to the Portuguese Atlantic region of Madeira. Basically they are small channels designed to bring the rain water from the upper elevations to the region around Funchal and other areas that need the water. We saw the water flowing through channels along the roads as we climbed our way toward the start of the hike.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8108.png \"Levada\")\n\nThe first part of the hike was great, it was right along the Levada with great scenery lovely trees and greenery. Quite an engineering project if you ask me!\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8115.png \"Downhill Levada\")\n\nAfter about 4 miles of hiking we found ourselves at the actual 25 Fontes part of the hike! The usual way to the start of the hike was just a boring walk downhill on a very narrow road. So this way was much better and more interesting. But by then we were pretty tired from the long rough descent, so we only did a small part of the original hike. \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8133.png \"Waterfalls\")\n\nBy the time we finished it was 2:00 in the afternoon and we hadn’t really eaten anything other than a few snacks. So we picked a lovely restaurant down by the sea to stop for a delicious lunch!\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8146.png \"Lunch at Engenho Velho\")\n\nThe view was amazing and the food was great also! Brian had Scabbard fish, Jane had baked Octopus, I had Portuguese black pork and Holly had Tuna steak. All deliciously prepared over an open fire. We all shared and all the dishes were really good.\n\nBy the time we got back to our AirBNB we were ready for showers and then happy hour. At happy hour we tried the Poncha and some Portuguese green wine, and a cheese plate. We played a game of Qwirkle at another local establishment and called it a night at 10pm! Tomorrow is another HUGE day of hiking.\n\n\n",

We were glad to get back to the hotel and put our overstuffed bodies to bed for the night. We had an all day tour of the city booked for the morning beginning at 9:30. Note that Buenos Aires is 3 hours ahead of Minneapolis so we were not too jet lagged, but still quite sleep deprived.</p>\n<p>The tour of BA was fabulous, our tour guide’s name was Fabio and he was both knowledgeable and an excellent story teller. We had lots of questions and he seemed to really thrive on our back and forth. Our first stop of the day was at the government center. It was a big day/weekend as they were inaugurating a new mayor as well as a new president. Our impression was that this new president was going to be a trump-like disaster for Argentina, but it seems most people remain hopeful, that he will be an influence for change but moderated by the legislature that he must work with. Democracy in Argentina over the years has not been easy with many coups and rebellions. I won’t try to recap it all in this post, but I feel compelled to re-watch Evita with a new perspective. We did see the balcony that Eva Peron and Madonna both used.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Evita our second stop was at the cemetery where she is interred. Her mausoleum is one of the most visited places in the city. This cemetery is just amazing as everyone is in some kind of crypt or mausoleum. When a family buys a place there they own it forever, but if they stop maintaining the site then it begins to decay. So we saw many amazing graves and many that had been grand years ago that were now full of spider webs and weeds. It was like a small town all to itself with streets and avenues going all over.</p>\n<p>Having had our fill of beef the night before we politely asked Fabio for a different option for lunch. He pulled through and brought us to a small family run place that made killer empanadas. By this time it was well after 1 and we didn’t finish lunch until 3. We still had one more stop on our tour!</p>\n<p>The highlight of the final stop was a drive by of the stadium where the Boca Juniors play. The club of Maradonna! The blue and yellow colors of the teem seemed oddly familiar to me, and I’ll tell you why. It seems that there were two teams in the city with the same colors, and they had a match to see who could keep the current colors, the loser would have to choose new colors. The Bocas lost, and the owners declared that they would adopt the colors of the next ship to dock in the harbor. That ship turned out to be flying the Swedish flag!</p>\n<p>It was 5pm by the time we arrived back at the hotel. We were going to have dinner, and then take in a Tango show which didn’t start until 10! On top of that our bus to the airport for our charter flight to Ushuaia was going to be leaving between 4:30 and 5:00 AM the next morning!! Sound a little crazy? Well, we made it through, and are enjoying a couple of down days on the journey to Antarctica to catch up on sleep. More on that in the next post.</p>\n<p>The dinner was pretty forgettable, and 3 out of 4 of us enjoyed the Tango show. OK, the music was good, I just have never learned to appreciate dance. For me the show could have ended after an hour but it kept going for another 40 minutes with various flourishes and bows and a dramatic rendition of “Don’t cry for me Argentina” to wrap up the show. It was after midnight by the time we walked back to our hotel, and yes, the alarm needed to be set for 4:15AM. There will be time to sleep later.</p>\n",

We did see the balcony that Eva Peron and Madonna both used.\n\nSpeaking of Evita our second stop was at the cemetery where she is interred. Her mausoleum is one of the most visited places in the city. This cemetery is just amazing as everyone is in some kind of crypt or mausoleum. When a family buys a place there they own it forever, but if they stop maintaining the site then it begins to decay. So we saw many amazing graves and many that had been grand years ago that were now full of spider webs and weeds. It was like a small town all to itself with streets and avenues going all over.\n\nHaving had our fill of beef the night before we politely asked Fabio for a different option for lunch. He pulled through and brought us to a small family run place that made killer empanadas. By this time it was well after 1 and we didn’t finish lunch until 3. We still had one more stop on our tour!\n\nThe highlight of the final stop was a drive by of the stadium where the Boca Juniors play. The club of Maradonna! The blue and yellow colors of the teem seemed oddly familiar to me, and I’ll tell you why. It seems that there were two teams in the city with the same colors, and they had a match to see who could keep the current colors, the loser would have to choose new colors. The Bocas lost, and the owners declared that they would adopt the colors of the next ship to dock in the harbor. That ship turned out to be flying the Swedish flag!\n\nIt was 5pm by the time we arrived back at the hotel. We were going to have dinner, and then take in a Tango show which didn’t start until 10! On top of that our bus to the airport for our charter flight to Ushuaia was going to be leaving between 4:30 and 5:00 AM the next morning!! Sound a little crazy? Well, we made it through, and are enjoying a couple of down days on the journey to Antarctica to catch up on sleep. More on that in the next post.\n\nThe dinner was pretty forgettable, and 3 out of 4 of us enjoyed the Tango show. OK, the music was good, I just have never learned to appreciate dance. For me the show could have ended after an hour but it kept going for another 40 minutes with various flourishes and bows and a dramatic rendition of “Don’t cry for me Argentina” to wrap up the show. It was after midnight by the time we walked back to our hotel, and yes, the alarm needed to be set for 4:15AM. There will be time to sleep later.\n\n\n",

We got to Acadia a day early to try to maximize the nice weather, and are doing the same to try to enjoy some New Hampshire \"leaf peeping.\" Personally I've now done enough leaf peeping to last me a while, but everywhere you turn there are hillsides full of vibrant colors.

Cars everywhere. Astronaut scarecrows, firefighter scarecrows, They were everywhere.  Kind of funny and clever.  One of the few things we didn&rsquo;t take a picture of, sadly.</p>\n<p>Eventually we made it to Lunenburg where we found a good viewpoint to take a photo of the town, with its colorful buildings and tall ships in the harbor.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Around four O&rsquo;clock we parked and walked to the Shipwreck Brewery tap room.

Trying to make a triangle out of the situation was not a good solution.  No trails from here to there, and the distance would have made the ride too long.  So, we decide to turn back, maybe stop at a brewery along the way back, and see where to go.  Riding along and discussing the options further, we decide to just head back to the truck and then drive from there to Lunenburg.  Jane really wanted to see Lunenburg as it is a UNESCO site.  \n\nTo get there we had to drive through Mahone Bay.   What a zoo!  We drove into their annual Scarecrow Festival!  People everywhere.  Cars everywhere. Astronaut scarecrows, firefighter scarecrows, They were everywhere.  Kind of funny and clever.  One of the few things we didn't take a picture of, sadly.\n\nEventually we made it to Lunenburg where we found a good viewpoint to take a photo of the town, with its colorful buildings and tall ships in the harbor.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/img-7979.jpeg\" alt=\"IMG 7979\" title=\"IMG_7979.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"404\" />\n\nAround four O'clock we parked and walked to the Shipwreck Brewery tap room.  The smell of pizza was a little overwhelming as we walked in! We hadn't much to eat, and had just ridden 30 miles. After looking at the menu we decided the chicken could wait!  One small pizza and one lobster roll to go with our beers please.\n\n",

Because it is quite possibly the worst stretch of highway we have ever been directed to drive by any maps application ever.  Not counting the horrible dike road incident at <a href=\"https://reputablejournal.com/2021/10/21/google-maps-you.html\">Lake Chilcot Arkansas</a> in 2021.  That was clearly not a highway.  The first warning was that there was no gas or service for 120km.  The next bad sign was that the speed limit was 80km/h but we couldn&rsquo;t drive more than about 50!

				"content_text": "No I haven't suddenly become a Rascal Flatts fan!  But 40km into the 120km stretch of NB 108 (New Brunswick 108 East) that phrase came into my mind.  Why?  Because it is quite possibly the worst stretch of highway we have ever been directed to drive by any maps application ever.  Not counting the horrible dike road incident at [Lake Chilcot Arkansas](https://reputablejournal.com/2021/10/21/google-maps-you.html) in 2021.  That was clearly not a highway.  The first warning was that there was no gas or service for 120km.  The next bad sign was that the speed limit was 80km/h but we couldn't drive more than about 50!  The road was **broken**!

				"content_html": "<p>We started this morning with a hike from the upper to middle to lower falls at Letchworth State Park, and ended with the Gorge hike at Watkins Glenn. What a great day of waterfalls!</p>\n<p>I have already had to rethink my opinion of New York State, which is totally based on my experience with New York City and “New Yorkers”. The rural parts of New York are amazing!</p>\n<p>We spent last night at Letchworth state park, which claims to be the number one state park in the USA. I don’t know how you can possibly back up such a claim, but as the pundits say, Letchworth belongs in the conversation! Beautiful, well kept, great hiking options &hellip;</p>\n<p>I don’t think our neighbors would vote for it&hellip; When we pulled into our loop and saw the water station we pulled over&hellip; Before we got out of the truck a guy on a bike pulled up to tell us “some guy just jack-knifed his camper, and is blocking the road. You might want to take your time! So we did, and even then the poor couple was no closer to a solution. They had unhooked their truck from the camper but were trying to reconnect in completely the wrong way! Husband and wife were barely talking to each other. But they did offer to move so that we could try to get around. We did, and we were all settled before they got into their site.</p>\n<p>We had not thought to take anything out of the freezer for dinner, so we took out a couple of stakes and I put them in the sous vide while we headed to Eddy’s to watch the sunset! It was very nice with a great view of the river gorge and the sun disappearing behind the bluffs!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/b36cfd59d3.jpeg\" alt=\"Sunset in Letchworth State Park\"></p>\n<p>The morning was quite cool, we had to turn on the heat for a few minutes to take the chill out of the air. We dressed in layers and headed out towards middle and upper falls. Our plan was to hike from there down to the lower falls and back, about a 4 mile hike.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/96bf0175-4eab-4ea6-ab2f-4c493c79c6fb.jpeg\" alt=\"Upper Falls\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/6603edc44a.jpeg\" alt=\"Middle Falls with Upper Falls in the Background\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/1714fd26f9.jpeg\" alt=\"Lower Falls\"></p>\n<p>It was a great morning for a hike. There was almost nobody else on the trail. We did meet a couple from Ohio who had just come from Watkins Glen, so they had good advice for us on how to do the gorge hike.</p>\n<p>After showers and some tacos for lunch we packed up camp and headed for Watkins Glen.

				"content_text": "We started this morning with a hike from the upper to middle to lower falls at Letchworth State Park, and ended with the Gorge hike at Watkins Glenn. What a great day of waterfalls!\n\nI have already had to rethink my opinion of New York State, which is totally based on my experience with New York City and “New Yorkers”. The rural parts of New York are amazing!\n\nWe spent last night at Letchworth state park, which claims to be the number one state park in the USA. I don’t know how you can possibly back up such a claim, but as the pundits say, Letchworth belongs in the conversation! Beautiful, well kept, great hiking options ... \n\nI don’t think our neighbors would vote for it... When we pulled into our loop and saw the water station we pulled over... Before we got out of the truck a guy on a bike pulled up to tell us “some guy just jack-knifed his camper, and is blocking the road. You might want to take your time! So we did, and even then the poor couple was no closer to a solution. They had unhooked their truck from the camper but were trying to reconnect in completely the wrong way! Husband and wife were barely talking to each other. But they did offer to move so that we could try to get around. We did, and we were all settled before they got into their site. \n\nWe had not thought to take anything out of the freezer for dinner, so we took out a couple of stakes and I put them in the sous vide while we headed to Eddy’s to watch the sunset! It was very nice with a great view of the river gorge and the sun disappearing behind the bluffs!\n\n![Sunset in Letchworth State Park](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/b36cfd59d3.jpeg)\n\nThe morning was quite cool, we had to turn on the heat for a few minutes to take the chill out of the air. We dressed in layers and headed out towards middle and upper falls. Our plan was to hike from there down to the lower falls and back, about a 4 mile hike.\n\n![Upper Falls](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/96bf0175-4eab-4ea6-ab2f-4c493c79c6fb.jpeg)\n\n![Middle Falls with Upper Falls in the Background](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/6603edc44a.jpeg)\n\n![Lower Falls](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/1714fd26f9.jpeg)\n\nIt was a great morning for a hike. There was almost nobody else on the trail. We did meet a couple from Ohio who had just come from Watkins Glen, so they had good advice for us on how to do the gorge hike. \n\nAfter showers and some tacos for lunch we packed up camp and headed for Watkins Glen. It was just a two hour drive, and on much better roads than the route we took to Letchworth!!\n\nThe campground sits high above the village of Watkins Glen, and the gorge hike starts way down low. So we descended and then started the long trek back upwards. But it was spectacular.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/d1b6f7ab-624d-4870-88d3-926e24dacf19.jpeg)\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/6800f60f-9dc7-457d-b9a0-476f1c575b34.jpeg)\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/a115f3bc-5273-4144-99d4-3d975b8fba12.jpeg)\n\nAfter all of that hiking and climbing we were definitely hungry and sleepy campers.

And not done with new technology!  Much of the canal has not changed since it was built over 100 years ago.  No pumps are used, it is all gravity fed.  Which means that in order for the locks to work they are draining the lake.  Of course it is refilled by the river, but each ship uses about 52 million gallons of water to traverse the locks.  The rainy season has not been very rainy this year so the lake level is down which means some ships can&rsquo;t go through, or they have to unload some cargo before they go.  One interesting addition that helps conserve water is that now we can use water from the side going down to halfway fill the side going up.  This is a nice bit of recycling that saves about 50% of the water.</p>\n",

The white and blue ship is a car carrier heading the opposite direction.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/8c7e3c54ae.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 7094\" title=\"IMG_7094.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" />\n\nHere we are in the lock looking backward you can see a tanker heading out.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/9913b0a5ca.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 7106\" title=\"IMG_7106.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n\n\nWe then travelled across the lake (formed by damming the Chagres river) to the Pedro Miguel locks which stepped us down about 50 feet and then on the the Miraflores locks which took us down to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThis sequence just shows us at the Miraflores locks dropping down the final step before we head out.\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/8ea3cbdf42.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 1129\" title=\"IMG_1129.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" />\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/93b2c59204.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 1130\" title=\"IMG_1130.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"337\" />\n\nPanama City in the background.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/ef7f62e285.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 7125\" title=\"IMG_7125.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"334\" />\n\nThe whole thing is such an engineering marvel.  And not done with new technology!  Much of the canal has not changed since it was built over 100 years ago.  No pumps are used, it is all gravity fed.  Which means that in order for the locks to work they are draining the lake.  Of course it is refilled by the river, but each ship uses about 52 million gallons of water to traverse the locks.  The rainy season has not been very rainy this year so the lake level is down which means some ships can't go through, or they have to unload some cargo before they go.  One interesting addition that helps conserve water is that now we can use water from the side going down to halfway fill the side going up.  This is a nice bit of recycling that saves about 50% of the water.\n\n",

				"content_html": "<p>This morning I got Wordle in 2!  Here is Proof:<br>\nWordle 564 2/6*<br>\n⬜🟨🟨🟨🟨<br>\n🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩</p>\n<p>Since I won&rsquo;t post this until tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll tell you my first guess.  It was DELAY. I know there are better words but my personal practice on wordle is to sit and think about my day for a few minutes and then try to come up with a good starting word that is somehow related to those thoughts. Sort of a Wordle meditation.  I have rules, I&rsquo;m not going to use double letters, its not going to be super obscure, or use letters that are too rare. Although QUEST would not be out of the question.</p>\n<p>Now you may be wondering why DELAY was my word today.  Well, it all started yesterday afternoon, in Minnesota, under a winter storm warning.  I could see traffic on the I-35W bridge over the Missippi was slow from the window in our condo, then I couldn&rsquo;t see the bridge at all.  Not good.  We were scheduled to fly back to Palm Springs at 6:07PM, so after some discussion we put on our backpacks at 2:40PM and headed for the light rail station near US Bank stadium, about 8 blocks or so.  The going was slow and we didn&rsquo;t know how the trains were doing but we were pretty sure it was a better option than Uber or Lyft.  We got to the station at 3:07 and had about 10 minutes to wait for the Blue Line toward the Mall of America.  Things were running much smoother than anticipated so we arrived at the airport <strong>way</strong> ahead of our typical 90 minutes before departure.  We knew we needed some extra time to grab an early bite to eat since dinner time would come somewhere over Denver.</p>\n<p>About halfway into our dinner the Flighty app told me that our flight had just been delayed.  I was a little surprised because I had been following the progress of our plane and I knew it was already at the airport.  Must be a crew issue I thought.  So we stretched out our meal, watched the people for a while and then headed to our gate.  Sure enough we were waiting for a crew that was now &ldquo;flying around the weather.&rdquo; That sort of flying continued for some time as small delay after small delay started to add up.</p>\n<p>Finally, a crew was located, and we started the boarding process.  After about 20 minutes on the plane we saw the captain and co-pilot arrive and they announced that there would be a bit more delay as they did their inspection and pre-flight paperwork.  Then there was more waiting until an announcement was made that the ground crews could not keep up with the freezing rain and they were closing the airport!  I&rsquo;ve never seen this happen in Minnesota!! We are hearty, we don&rsquo;t shut down our airports for mere rain and sleet and snow. That kind of behavior is reserved for wimpy east coast sorts. 🤪</p>\n<p>It seems that as we were sitting on the plane another plane had slid off the end of the runway.  Ok, that might be a pretty good indicator that its time to close up shop for a while.  So we had to get off the plane again.  The gate agent assured us that the airport would open again around 10 or 10:30 PM and that we would be underway as soon as possible.   Ummm I wonder what that means?  You can&rsquo;t just shut down everything and then get 100&rsquo;s of delayed flights through de-icing and on the runway in a few minutes.</p>\n<p>We decided to bag it.  Lets just get on the delta app and click on that nice little button that says reschedule.  It really is not that big of an inconvenience for us to wait another day or two to escape the cold and snow.  As I was talking to another passenger I said the hardest thing for me was that I had to cancel my tee time for tomorrow.  Yeah, first world problems I know.  Unfortunately the little button on the app didn&rsquo;t work.  Probably because we had already boarded&hellip; The app helpfully suggested an 800 number to call to straighten out the problem.  Unfortunately the sole purpose of the voice on the 800 number is to convince you that using delta.com or the app on your phone is really by far the better option than waiting on what was a very long hold queue due to extremely high call volume. Delta if you are listening this <em>is</em> an area for improvement in what I must admit is quite a good app under most circumstances.</p>\n<p>I went up to ask the gate agent what we could do?  If we simply walk away now can we rebook later tonight? first thing tomorrow? Can you release us so that we can rebook ourselves? Instead she got on her terminal and rebooked us for this morning at 8:55.  Thanks helpful gate agent! I wish I had caught your name.  Next stop light rail station!</p>\n<p>The path to the light rail station at MSP involves two fairly long escalators.  At the bottom of the first we were intercepted by transit police.  Crap, I thought they have closed the light rail and we are going to have to wait hours for a very expensive Uber in this weather.  Nope, just a short delay due to a suspicious object on the tracks.

				"content_text": "This morning I got Wordle in 2!  Here is Proof:  \nWordle 564 2/6*  \n⬜🟨🟨🟨🟨  \n🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩  \n\nSince I won't post this until tomorrow, I'll tell you my first guess.  It was DELAY. I know there are better words but my personal practice on wordle is to sit and think about my day for a few minutes and then try to come up with a good starting word that is somehow related to those thoughts. Sort of a Wordle meditation.  I have rules, I'm not going to use double letters, its not going to be super obscure, or use letters that are too rare. Although QUEST would not be out of the question.\n\nNow you may be wondering why DELAY was my word today.  Well, it all started yesterday afternoon, in Minnesota, under a winter storm warning.  I could see traffic on the I-35W bridge over the Missippi was slow from the window in our condo, then I couldn't see the bridge at all.  Not good.  We were scheduled to fly back to Palm Springs at 6:07PM, so after some discussion we put on our backpacks at 2:40PM and headed for the light rail station near US Bank stadium, about 8 blocks or so.  The going was slow and we didn't know how the trains were doing but we were pretty sure it was a better option than Uber or Lyft.  We got to the station at 3:07 and had about 10 minutes to wait for the Blue Line toward the Mall of America.  Things were running much smoother than anticipated so we arrived at the airport **way** ahead of our typical 90 minutes before departure.  We knew we needed some extra time to grab an early bite to eat since dinner time would come somewhere over Denver.\n\nAbout halfway into our dinner the Flighty app told me that our flight had just been delayed.  I was a little surprised because I had been following the progress of our plane and I knew it was already at the airport.  Must be a crew issue I thought.  So we stretched out our meal, watched the people for a while and then headed to our gate.  Sure enough we were waiting for a crew that was now \"flying around the weather.\" That sort of flying continued for some time as small delay after small delay started to add up.  \n\nFinally, a crew was located, and we started the boarding process.  After about 20 minutes on the plane we saw the captain and co-pilot arrive and they announced that there would be a bit more delay as they did their inspection and pre-flight paperwork.  Then there was more waiting until an announcement was made that the ground crews could not keep up with the freezing rain and they were closing the airport!  I've never seen this happen in Minnesota!! We are hearty, we don't shut down our airports for mere rain and sleet and snow. That kind of behavior is reserved for wimpy east coast sorts. 🤪\n\nIt seems that as we were sitting on the plane another plane had slid off the end of the runway.  Ok, that might be a pretty good indicator that its time to close up shop for a while.  So we had to get off the plane again.  The gate agent assured us that the airport would open again around 10 or 10:30 PM and that we would be underway as soon as possible.   Ummm I wonder what that means?  You can't just shut down everything and then get 100's of delayed flights through de-icing and on the runway in a few minutes.  \n\nWe decided to bag it.  Lets just get on the delta app and click on that nice little button that says reschedule.  It really is not that big of an inconvenience for us to wait another day or two to escape the cold and snow.  As I was talking to another passenger I said the hardest thing for me was that I had to cancel my tee time for tomorrow.  Yeah, first world problems I know.  Unfortunately the little button on the app didn't work.  Probably because we had already boarded... The app helpfully suggested an 800 number to call to straighten out the problem.  Unfortunately the sole purpose of the voice on the 800 number is to convince you that using delta.com or the app on your phone is really by far the better option than waiting on what was a very long hold queue due to extremely high call volume. Delta if you are listening this *is* an area for improvement in what I must admit is quite a good app under most circumstances.\n\nI went up to ask the gate agent what we could do?  If we simply walk away now can we rebook later tonight? first thing tomorrow? Can you release us so that we can rebook ourselves? Instead she got on her terminal and rebooked us for this morning at 8:55.  Thanks helpful gate agent! I wish I had caught your name.  Next stop light rail station!  \n\nThe path to the light rail station at MSP involves two fairly long escalators.  At the bottom of the first we were intercepted by transit police.  Crap, I thought they have closed the light rail and we are going to have to wait hours for a very expensive Uber in this weather.  Nope, just a short delay due to a suspicious object on the tracks. Maybe no more than 5 minutes, unless it really is a bomb.  Luckily the bomb dog was back up the escalator in no time apparently having no interest in said suspicious object.  To make a long story short we were home and ready for bed before they reopened the airport!\n\nAt 6:40 AM we begin to retrace our steps to the airport once again.  This morning the sidewalks are actually worse than they were 16 hours ago.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/5a9d79e220.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 6854\" title=\"IMG_6854.jpeg\" border=\"0\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" />\n\nHere we are on our way back to the light rail stations in the snow.  \n\nBack at the airport, we stop at the first kiosk we see to get new boarding passes which thankfully had our TSA PreCheck status on them!

Our hotel was a Baymont tonight, and I’m not sure why, but the hotel had a some special “mini-rooms” even the door was about 3/4 of a normal width. This was our room for the night.

Here is a nice Sunset shot!\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/3a03c3058c.jpg)\n\nAnd to follow up, here is a sunrise photo from the same spot.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ef65214794.jpg)\n\nA long drive down I 15 brought us to Cedar City Utah for our third night. We headed up to Brian Head, a ski area and did a short little hike. My foot was feeling better by this time, but we still didn’t want to do too much. I love this shot of the show against the beautiful red rock! Our hotel was a Baymont tonight, and I’m not sure why, but the hotel had a some special “mini-rooms” even the door was about 3/4 of a normal width. This was our room for the night. The saving grace for the hotel was that it was near a brewery and a really excellent pizza place! I had a chicken pizza with white sauce and pistachios! Truly amazing.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/0e8f07e8df.jpg)\n\nOur last day was the final push to Indio. But we made a quick stop at Kolob Canyon to take a short hike. Maybe some of the most spectacular views yet.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6bf335e303.jpg)\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6db3df6ebf.jpg)\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/49d408b358.jpg)\n\nThis was a great way to do the trip out this year. We averaged about 6-7 hours of driving a day with time at the end of each day for a short hike or some site seeing.\n\n\n",

But lots of others too, apparently the Firehouse Brewery is trying to be the new Wall Drug. They have signs and bright red fire trucks every few miles. Here are a few of our favorite slogans.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mexican food so good that Donald Trump would build a wall around it!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don’t even remember if the name of the restaurant was mentioned. But I would love to eat there to support the owners.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is wisdom in wine.</p>\n<p>There is bacteria in water</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Love it, let’s have a glass of wine to celebrate the author of that sign.</p>\n<p>I have to say that South Dakota is not a good value; it is pretty expensive scenery at almost $1.00 per mile! The reason that today was particularly expensive was the headwind. We were driving straight into a 20 mph wind gusting to 40 mph at times.

				"content_text": "Today (Day 2) was a day of driving across South Dakota. What do you see when driving across South Dakota? Billboards, lots and lots of billboards. Wall Drug, of course. But lots of others too, apparently the Firehouse Brewery is trying to be the new Wall Drug. They have signs and bright red fire trucks every few miles. Here are a few of our favorite slogans.\n\n> Mexican food so good that Donald Trump would build a wall around it!\n\nI don’t even remember if the name of the restaurant was mentioned. But I would love to eat there to support the owners.\n\n> There is wisdom in wine.\n> \n> There is bacteria in water\n\nLove it, let’s have a glass of wine to celebrate the author of that sign.\n\nI have to say that South Dakota is not a good value; it is pretty expensive scenery at almost $1.00 per mile! The reason that today was particularly expensive was the headwind. We were driving straight into a 20 mph wind gusting to 40 mph at times. Our gas mileage is normally 9-10 mph while pulling our camper, but today we were averaging 5.3. Yikes!

The first thing we learned was that the roadside assistance provided with the rental was completely useless.

Discussions ensued with the owner of the RV who seemed pretty knowledgeable and correctly diagnosed what the problem was.

A little further down the road we got word that we should head to Chris’s Auto Repair in Sioux Falls. If you ever need some work done on your car in Sioux Falls I would highly recommend, they are the nicest group you will find.

We had to take the camper through the tunnel, which was interesting because they make the tunnel one way traffic whenever there is a camper or bus that needs to go through. The road is just a little too narrow for comfort and although two campers could probably pass each other many mirrors would be broken. From there we went through Kanab and then onward toward Page Arizona.</p>\n<p>About 20 miles outside of Kanab we came to a sudden stop. There was a huge lineup of cars on our side of the road and no oncoming traffic except for the few cars we could see turning around. With no cell service it was a total mystery as to what had transpired ahead. We assumed it was an accident of some kind. But how long would we have to wait? After sitting some time the paramedics from Kanab came by heading toward the accident, so we knew it would be quite a while. Jerry and I decided to take a little hike up the road to see if we could find any information or even just to see if we could see the start of the backup. After walking about a mile we started chatting with another person who said that there had been a lot of smoke and the word was that a camper had tipped over and caught fire. Rescue crews were looking for volunteer vehicles to help clear the road. But nobody knew how long it would be before we could get underway.</p>\n<p>We met people with timed reservations at Antelope canyon, and others on their way to Lake Powell every car on our walk back wanted to know if we had learned anything. We we tried to tell what we knew in ever decreasing detail. A few minutes after getting back to the car we could see the front of the line start to move. It was just about 1 hour delay. Luckily we were not on any time schedule. We could clearly see the problem when we got to the front! We hope everyone survived! This really made us think about the dangers of driving in remote areas, no cell service in this area? We can only imagine how long that RV burned before word got to the authorities and someone was able to respond 20 miles from the nearest town!</p>\n<p>The other unfortunate thing about the day was that the wind was just howling 20 mph with gusts of much more. At our campsite we could hardly close our door with both hands! Needless to say we were not going to sit around in the camper in the wind, so we headed down to see horseshoe bend. It takes a bit to walk down to the viewpoint and on the way there we had convinced ourselves that the wind was letting up a bit. But when we got to the edge of the canyon overlooking the bend we were sand blasted! You could hardly stand it with the bits of sand and gravel whipping around and stinging your skin.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1af3fe0e7a.png\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/904a3b69ea.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>So maybe outdoor hiking is not a good idea today either. Maybe we should go into page to the brewery and distillery? That turned out to be a great call. Good beer, decent pizza and some really nice gin — made with botanicals. Yes, I am on vacation I had gin and beer.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/87269a4521.png\" alt=\"\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/76ae1cf30b.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Back at the camper the wind had calmed down so we settled in for a rousing game of “Mexican Train” dominoes. It was a game full of twists and turns, just when we thought we had it figured out Jane staged a dramatic last minute victory.</p>\n",

With no cell service it was a total mystery as to what had transpired ahead. We assumed it was an accident of some kind. But how long would we have to wait? After sitting some time the paramedics from Kanab came by heading toward the accident, so we knew it would be quite a while. Jerry and I decided to take a little hike up the road to see if we could find any information or even just to see if we could see the start of the backup. After walking about a mile we started chatting with another person who said that there had been a lot of smoke and the word was that a camper had tipped over and caught fire. Rescue crews were looking for volunteer vehicles to help clear the road. But nobody knew how long it would be before we could get underway.\n\nWe met people with timed reservations at Antelope canyon, and others on their way to Lake Powell every car on our walk back wanted to know if we had learned anything. We we tried to tell what we knew in ever decreasing detail. A few minutes after getting back to the car we could see the front of the line start to move. It was just about 1 hour delay. Luckily we were not on any time schedule. We could clearly see the problem when we got to the front! We hope everyone survived! This really made us think about the dangers of driving in remote areas, no cell service in this area? We can only imagine how long that RV burned before word got to the authorities and someone was able to respond 20 miles from the nearest town!\n\nThe other unfortunate thing about the day was that the wind was just howling 20 mph with gusts of much more. At our campsite we could hardly close our door with both hands! Needless to say we were not going to sit around in the camper in the wind, so we headed down to see horseshoe bend. It takes a bit to walk down to the viewpoint and on the way there we had convinced ourselves that the wind was letting up a bit. But when we got to the edge of the canyon overlooking the bend we were sand blasted! You could hardly stand it with the bits of sand and gravel whipping around and stinging your skin.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1af3fe0e7a.png)![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/904a3b69ea.png)\n\nSo maybe outdoor hiking is not a good idea today either. Maybe we should go into page to the brewery and distillery? That turned out to be a great call. Good beer, decent pizza and some really nice gin — made with botanicals. Yes, I am on vacation I had gin and beer. \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/87269a4521.png)![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/76ae1cf30b.png)\n\nBack at the camper the wind had calmed down so we settled in for a rousing game of “Mexican Train” dominoes. It was a game full of twists and turns, just when we thought we had it figured out Jane staged a dramatic last minute victory.\n\n",

Which meant that every time jane got into a little deeper water the pressure on the suit forced the cold water inside the suit to squeeze up! Not comfortable. At this point our hike became a march to get back to the trailhead as quickly as we could to get the women out of their wet clothes.

This hike was downhill from the start and uphill all the way back!\n\nThis was the end of the hike where we could see the plains below the window from our valley!\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5c9dd62faa.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e5a7c4ba64.png)\n\nOn the way back we had several opportunities to enjoy the beautiful lighting! This one is my favorite, I really love the reflection of the mountains beyond in this tiny pool.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2c5f86c29c.png)\n\nI also loved the contrast in the lighting, from the shadow we were walking in to the canyon walls still in bright, late afternoon sunlight!\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6b69a04fe7.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cca8863999.png)\n\nWe didn’t get back from the hike until after 7:00 so after a drink and a bit of rest it was dark by the time I started the griddle for supper. We had decided on fried burgers. I haven’t made a burger on a flat top in forever, but let me tell you, it was great! Nicely browned on the outside and we toasted some buttered buns right next to the burgers! It took me right back to my childhood having burgers at the Cafe in Storden Minnesota with my grandma Sundahl.\n\nThis morning we were up and waiting for the sun to clear the canyon wall so we could position the solar panels for the day before we took off on our sightseeing tour. It was great.\n\nWe followed the Ross Maxwell road (an early park super) and it was beautiful! The highlight of the trip was the view of “the notch” No! not the one on the iPhone or the new macbook pro, but a gigantic notch between the mountains carved out by the Rio Grande! This was our first view of it from about 10 miles away!\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4157e62878.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f686df28b4.png)\n\nWhen we got closer it was great to get out and walk into the canyon. The drought is so bad that the Rio Grande is very low .\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/81c569a020.png)\n\nSo low, in fact, that we were definitely in Mexico for a few minutes!\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/17879f5530.png)\n\n\n",

On our way into town we stopped at the Cape Bicycle shop to stock up on some supplies. I had a great chat with one of the guys in the store (owner maybe). He gave me some good riding advice, and some recommendations on where we could get a good pizza and some local brew. Minglewood brewery was the place. We were able to hang out, enjoy some beer, tater-tot nachos, and pizza while watching the US Mens national team. I would recommend both Minglewood and the cycle shop if you are passing through.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/0fd377231c.png)![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/86d8276a80.png)![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2466c67faf.png)\n\nAfter a pretty bad nights sleep, my back was hurting, so I just did a short ride around on the park roads. \n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/413d1fcba8.png)\n\nJane had taken off with the truck to do a hike and I had left my helmet in the truck. So I didn’t want to go on the highway and I didn’t want to go far or fast anyway, so a gentle ride to stretch my muscles was all I wanted. Jane’s hike was like a trip through the jungle, she had to use her walking sticks to clear away the spider webs!\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/98e584cd40.png)\n\nOne of the things the guys in the bike shop told me, which of course Jane already knew, was not to ride across this bridge!!\n\n![Do NOT ride or walk your bike over this very narrow bridge.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cb395f1f0c.png)\n\nSince it was a day to ride in the truck, I did not! Instead we rode together to Columbus Belmont state park. After setting up camp I had just enough signal to participate in the afternoon plenary session of the Concordia board meeting. \n\nOur campground host was very welcoming, and was willing to deliver a nice load of wood for just $5. This was great as we made some pork satays over an open fire along with couscous and chickpeas. \n\n\n",

That continued for at least two or three miles until I got to the bridge to cross the Mississippi back into Missouri.

				"content_html": "<p>Well, I think it is time to head East. When we started making our egg scramble for breakfast this morning the sausage had mold on it, and so did one of our bags of shredded cheese! Its nothing that a stop at a grocery store won’t fix, but we are both ready anyway. We’ve been on the road with the camper for 20 days, and it has been quite a trip.</p>\n<p>The last few days have been really wonderful. We got to park the camper at Lake Chelan State Park and hang out with our friends Jim and Karen for three days! Jim and Karen are experts on the Chelan and Leavenworth areas having both lived in the area before, so they had lots of great outings planned for us.</p>\n<p>Day One, we met at the Wal-mart parking lot to leave the camper until check-in time and headed out for a wine tasting and lunch! We found a great location at Benson’s who also served a great local wood fired pizza. Check out this amazing view of Lake Chelan from our lunch stop!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/847e7e8326.jpg\" alt=\"Wine and lunch at Benson’s winery\"></p>\n<p>That pretty much captures the area in a nutshell. Everywhere you go you are treated to amazing views of the lake. By the time we finished lunch and our tasting it was late enough to move the camper to the campground.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/1f1adae372.jpg\" alt=\"Beautiful campsite at Lake Chelan State Park\"></p>\n<p>With the camper situated, we were able to explore the south side of the lake and see the Holden guest house that Jim helped build many years ago. We had another pre-dinner wine tasting at the Tsillan (pronounced Chelan) winery. The weather was HOT 95+ degrees. The wine was also really good. I’m bringing home bottles of Rosé and Pinot Grigio. Dinner was in downtown Chelan at Campbells, followed by a campfire back at our site. There were two big RV’s next door to us, each with a gaggle of kids and their bikes. The kids were riding their bikes back and forth, no hands, getting as close as they could to Jim and Karen’s car parked in front of our camper! This was making both Jim and Karen very nervous, and they were ready to make the drive back to their place anyway, so they left. Meanwhile the biking and the squeaky bike brakes continued long after dark! We laughed that we are edging ever closer to those old people that yell “get off my lawn!”</p>\n<p>Tuesday morning, Jim and I headed out for a ride up the lake. It was perfect weather and a great morning for a ride. My fat tire had to work hard to keep up with Jim’s road bike.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/80174e0bb8.jpg\" alt=\"Trying to Keep up with Jim\"></p>\n<p>We had bratwurst for lunch at the campground, and then Jim and Karen took off to take care of some family things. We were also awaiting the arrival of Jane’s aunt Joanne and uncle Dale. Her cousin David drove them up from Yakima to see us. This is Jane’s last remaining aunt and uncle and we haven’t seen them in years so it was great to see them and have a chance to chat.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/8fda9b38bb.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Wednesday, the plan was to head to Leavenworth, where Karen’s parents and cousins live. Karen had a favorite hike for us to do, and Jane’s cousin runs Visconti’s restaurant there. Leavenworth has been remodeled to resemble a Bavarian mountain village and is a charming little town. We enjoyed a lunch at a local Mexican restaurant (Yes, I know, not very Bavarian, but we just had brats for lunch on Tuesday). We visited the local fair trade store that was owned by Karen’s parents as well as the hat shop and toy shop owned by her uncle.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/076aa5d451.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Leavenworth\"></p>\n<p>Downtown was really hot, so we headed up the mountain to take a hike along the Icicle river. The snow melt is fast and furious in the mountains so the rivers are really flowing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/bc9e852f74.jpg\" alt=\"Wild Rapids\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/5409012594.jpg\" alt=\"Great to visit friends in Washington!\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/d429c22e4b.jpg\" alt=\"Not a selfie!\"></p>\n<p>Although the water was very cold and the temperatures up on the mountain were much cooler we were still all pretty hot and tired after the hike. So we showed up for our reservation an hour early. No problem we enjoyed some more local wine and eventually ordered our meal.</p>\n<p>Karen was going to spend a couple of days with her parents, helping out around the house, so we dropped her off before making the hour long trek back to the campground. By then we were tired so we just spent some time picking up the campsite and preparing for our morning departure.</p>\n<p>The campsite was very tight, and in addition, there was a car parked right across from our site, making our exit very narrow. after getting the trailer hooked up Jane nearly had us out of the site except for the large rock blocking the corner of our site. I had tried to move it earlier in the morning in preparation for our exit but couldn’t move it. Luckily there was a burly young man doing his dishes at the water faucet on the edge of our site who said “I can move that rock for you”. together we rolled it over and we were able to get the camper out. Our next move was to wake up the tenters that owned the parked car and ask them to move it. Thankfully that was not needed.</p>\n",

We got to park the camper at Lake Chelan State Park and hang out with our friends Jim and Karen for three days! Jim and Karen are experts on the Chelan and Leavenworth areas having both lived in the area before, so they had lots of great outings planned for us.\n\nDay One, we met at the Wal-mart parking lot to leave the camper until check-in time and headed out for a wine tasting and lunch! We found a great location at Benson’s who also served a great local wood fired pizza. Check out this amazing view of Lake Chelan from our lunch stop!\n\n![Wine and lunch at Benson’s winery](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/847e7e8326.jpg)\n\nThat pretty much captures the area in a nutshell. Everywhere you go you are treated to amazing views of the lake. By the time we finished lunch and our tasting it was late enough to move the camper to the campground.\n\n![Beautiful campsite at Lake Chelan State Park](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/1f1adae372.jpg)\n\nWith the camper situated, we were able to explore the south side of the lake and see the Holden guest house that Jim helped build many years ago. We had another pre-dinner wine tasting at the Tsillan (pronounced Chelan) winery. The weather was HOT 95+ degrees. The wine was also really good. I’m bringing home bottles of Rosé and Pinot Grigio. Dinner was in downtown Chelan at Campbells, followed by a campfire back at our site. There were two big RV’s next door to us, each with a gaggle of kids and their bikes. The kids were riding their bikes back and forth, no hands, getting as close as they could to Jim and Karen’s car parked in front of our camper! This was making both Jim and Karen very nervous, and they were ready to make the drive back to their place anyway, so they left. Meanwhile the biking and the squeaky bike brakes continued long after dark! We laughed that we are edging ever closer to those old people that yell “get off my lawn!”\n\nTuesday morning, Jim and I headed out for a ride up the lake. It was perfect weather and a great morning for a ride. My fat tire had to work hard to keep up with Jim’s road bike.\n\n![Trying to Keep up with Jim](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/80174e0bb8.jpg)\n\nWe had bratwurst for lunch at the campground, and then Jim and Karen took off to take care of some family things. We were also awaiting the arrival of Jane’s aunt Joanne and uncle Dale. Her cousin David drove them up from Yakima to see us. This is Jane’s last remaining aunt and uncle and we haven’t seen them in years so it was great to see them and have a chance to chat.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/8fda9b38bb.jpg)\n\nWednesday, the plan was to head to Leavenworth, where Karen’s parents and cousins live. Karen had a favorite hike for us to do, and Jane’s cousin runs Visconti’s restaurant there. Leavenworth has been remodeled to resemble a Bavarian mountain village and is a charming little town. We enjoyed a lunch at a local Mexican restaurant (Yes, I know, not very Bavarian, but we just had brats for lunch on Tuesday). We visited the local fair trade store that was owned by Karen’s parents as well as the hat shop and toy shop owned by her uncle.\n\n![Downtown Leavenworth](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/076aa5d451.jpg)\n\nDowntown was really hot, so we headed up the mountain to take a hike along the Icicle river. The snow melt is fast and furious in the mountains so the rivers are really flowing.\n\n![Wild Rapids](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/bc9e852f74.jpg)\n\n![Great to visit friends in Washington!](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/5409012594.jpg)\n\n![Not a selfie!](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/d429c22e4b.jpg)\n\nAlthough the water was very cold and the temperatures up on the mountain were much cooler we were still all pretty hot and tired after the hike. So we showed up for our reservation an hour early. No problem we enjoyed some more local wine and eventually ordered our meal.\n\nKaren was going to spend a couple of days with her parents, helping out around the house, so we dropped her off before making the hour long trek back to the campground. By then we were tired so we just spent some time picking up the campsite and preparing for our morning departure.\n\nThe campsite was very tight, and in addition, there was a car parked right across from our site, making our exit very narrow. after getting the trailer hooked up Jane nearly had us out of the site except for the large rock blocking the corner of our site. I had tried to move it earlier in the morning in preparation for our exit but couldn’t move it. Luckily there was a burly young man doing his dishes at the water faucet on the edge of our site who said “I can move that rock for you”. together we rolled it over and we were able to get the camper out. Our next move was to wake up the tenters that owned the parked car and ask them to move it. Thankfully that was not needed.\n\n\n",

				"content_text": "This morning we went through all the weather in about 30 minutes! We started out at our Salt Creek campsite, where the forecast was for 60 and overcast most of the day. But as we climbed toward Hurricane Ridge we got into the low clouds and rain. The temperature was dropping quickly as we went up, but then we emerged from the cloud into beautiful bright blue sunshine and we had the joy of looking down at the top of the clouds!\n\n![Looking down on the clouds](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/89eaae664f.jpg)\n\nIn our fun quest to retrace our steps were trying to find the place where we took a couple of pictures on Hurricane Ridge. I apologize for the short shorts! It was the 80’s after all.\n\n![Hurricane Ridge 1986](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/e05303acb8.jpg)\n\n![Hurricane Ridge Visitors Center 1986](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/fa9e141300.jpg)\n\nHere are today’s photos:\n\n![A little cooler in May 2021 than June 1986](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/59e281f653.jpg)\n\n![We should’a sat down](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/f1efdcf363.jpg)\n\nWe did a little more hiking to enjoy the spectacular views!\n\n![Hurricane Ridge](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/bb54e35c96.jpg)\n\nThen we were off to find Marymere falls!\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/d954c006b8.jpg)\n\nI’m not sure who took the photo in 1986, but they managed to make it a little blurry. This time it was very sweet. We were getting ready to do a selfie at the falls when the young couple behind us asked if we wanted them to take our picture. Sure, I said, we are trying to recreate this photo from 35 years ago I said. It is from our honeymoon, Jane added. This young couple had just gotten engaged. So they took our picture and added that 35 years was a long time and certainly something to aspire to. Oh my.\n\n![Marymere Falls 2021 — Good luck to the young couple that took our picture!](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/b319133824.jpg)\n\nAs we were headed back down the trail, I noticed that the bridge we had just crossed looked pretty familiar.

We also haven’t been hit by any purple rain, so we got that going for us. Only 98 miles to go to our campsite but the estimated time of arrival keeps holding steady so I guess all this traffic was anticipated. I’m happy to report that the temperature here on the 101 is a good 20 degrees cooler than when we left Indio just a few hours ago. That is down 20 degrees from 100!\n\nWe are now happily in our campsite at El Capitan State Beach! It is only 65 degrees here so its starting to feel like Minnesota, but we are so happy to be on the road and are already enjoying this new adventure! ![Our Campsite](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/88b7d2abd3.jpg)We got the camper set up and went for a short hike! ![Our ocean view!](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/821aba6061.jpg) Next up happy hour, dinner, and then some rest after a very busy day.\n\n\n",

I went up on deck to investigate and was happy to see that it was just a dense fog.  Caused by the cold water currents running up against the Galapagos ridge.  It would burn off.  All credit to Ann who insisted that we take the 10:00 excursion rather than the 8:00 excursion.  This is what the fog looked like just before we boarded our zodiac at 10.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bcfd94f4da.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We later learned that it was so foggy during the 8:00 trip that one of the zodiacs took a wrong turn in all of the mangrove and got lost for a bit.  Apparently everyone was taking it in stride and singing the theme song to Gillian’s island (except for one passenger who was not amused). I almost wish I was on that boat so I could tell the story in more detail.  Here you can just barely make out our ship in the fog from a distance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5c8ce6200f.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We were headed into a huge lagoon protected by mangroves but on the way we got some good sitings of a few of the marine birds.  Below is the famous Blue Footed Boobie.  Yes, I kind of giggle inside like a seventh grader every time I say that.  The reality is that the name comes from the fact that they act like clowns during their mating dance.  Kicking their legs up and flapping their wings and acting like fools.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2e27285da3.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We also got very close to a few brown pelicans.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/eb805ec318.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>And we saw the Galapagos Penguin!  The second smallest penguin in the world.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/86334688e8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>They look kind of dopey and slow when they are out of the water but when they are in the water they swim fast and graceful.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/32bdb78f53.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We saw turtles all over the place poking their heads out of the water, but it was not until the afternoon when we did our deep water snorkel that we really got to have a great view of the turtles.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1b7a7ff6b1.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Toward the end of the trip we were way back amongst the mangroves and we saw a sea lion sleeping on a branch just a few feet above the water.  We also had a very close encounter with a Great Blue Heron</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8314a61e70.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We were also lucky enough to see some golden rays swimming just beneath us. Too bad that we were not able to capture them on camera.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hike-at-tagus-bay\">Hike at Tagus Bay</h2>\n<p>The afternoon was in Tagus bay where we started with a drift snorkel. It was great, we saw a lot of sea turtles, and fish, but the most amazing was when I got to watch one of the penguins swimming underwater.</p>\n<p>After we dried off from the snorkel trip we headed out for the “fitness hike” This was billed as a faster paced walk with fewer stops but the same great scenery.  With people of all different ages on the cruise the walks tend to go at the pace of the slowest person in the group so we thought this would be a good option.  And it was.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7ef211c7f0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We climbed 150 stairs and then walked a bit to have a great view of the bay and this highly salty inland lake.</p>\n<p>After a mile we came to the end of the trail where we could see the difference between the two sides of the volcano we were climbing.  We were climbing the wet side and were suddenly treated to a huge vista of the dry side.  You could images that you had just landed on mars!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2ec72d6be8.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We took another short zodiac ride to view the geology of the volcano and some of the wildlife.

				"content_text": "Looking out the window in the morning we couldn’t see anything.  Had our luck changed?  Were we going to have a rainy day after all?  I went up on deck to investigate and was happy to see that it was just a dense fog.  Caused by the cold water currents running up against the Galapagos ridge.  It would burn off.  All credit to Ann who insisted that we take the 10:00 excursion rather than the 8:00 excursion.  This is what the fog looked like just before we boarded our zodiac at 10.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bcfd94f4da.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe later learned that it was so foggy during the 8:00 trip that one of the zodiacs took a wrong turn in all of the mangrove and got lost for a bit.  Apparently everyone was taking it in stride and singing the theme song to Gillian’s island (except for one passenger who was not amused). I almost wish I was on that boat so I could tell the story in more detail.  Here you can just barely make out our ship in the fog from a distance.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5c8ce6200f.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe were headed into a huge lagoon protected by mangroves but on the way we got some good sitings of a few of the marine birds.  Below is the famous Blue Footed Boobie.  Yes, I kind of giggle inside like a seventh grader every time I say that.  The reality is that the name comes from the fact that they act like clowns during their mating dance.  Kicking their legs up and flapping their wings and acting like fools.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2e27285da3.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe also got very close to a few brown pelicans.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/eb805ec318.jpg)\n\n\n\nAnd we saw the Galapagos Penguin!  The second smallest penguin in the world.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/86334688e8.jpg)\n\n\n\nThey look kind of dopey and slow when they are out of the water but when they are in the water they swim fast and graceful.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/32bdb78f53.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe saw turtles all over the place poking their heads out of the water, but it was not until the afternoon when we did our deep water snorkel that we really got to have a great view of the turtles.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1b7a7ff6b1.jpg)\n\n\n\nToward the end of the trip we were way back amongst the mangroves and we saw a sea lion sleeping on a branch just a few feet above the water.  We also had a very close encounter with a Great Blue Heron\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8314a61e70.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe were also lucky enough to see some golden rays swimming just beneath us. Too bad that we were not able to capture them on camera.\n\n\n\n## Hike at Tagus Bay\n\n\n\nThe afternoon was in Tagus bay where we started with a drift snorkel. It was great, we saw a lot of sea turtles, and fish, but the most amazing was when I got to watch one of the penguins swimming underwater.\n\n\n\nAfter we dried off from the snorkel trip we headed out for the “fitness hike” This was billed as a faster paced walk with fewer stops but the same great scenery.  With people of all different ages on the cruise the walks tend to go at the pace of the slowest person in the group so we thought this would be a good option.  And it was.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7ef211c7f0.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe climbed 150 stairs and then walked a bit to have a great view of the bay and this highly salty inland lake.\n\n\n\nAfter a mile we came to the end of the trail where we could see the difference between the two sides of the volcano we were climbing.  We were climbing the wet side and were suddenly treated to a huge vista of the dry side.  You could images that you had just landed on mars!\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2ec72d6be8.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe took another short zodiac ride to view the geology of the volcano and some of the wildlife.  Here you can see the layers where the older layers have oxidized!\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2e5ce39c2e.jpg)\n\n\n\nAfter we got back on the ship we had time to relax with a happy hour drink and enjoy the amazing sunset.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cbb6cff2d2.jpg)\n\n\n\nUp next was a delicious dinner where we watched one of our exhausted fellow passengers fall asleep right at her table with conversation and laughter going on all around her.  \n\n\n\nAfter dinner there was a small party to celebrate crossing the equator on our way around the north end of Isabella island.

The alarm was set to go off at 5AM, groaning internally I rolled over and listened to the rain turn from splatters to a steady stream.  Our goal for the day was to do the 7.5 mile Inca Trail hike to the Sun Gate of Machu Picchu.  I really was not looking forward to doing that in the rain!</p>\n<p>After much tossing and turning 5:00 finally came and we headed up for an early breakfast.  We were meeting our guide and driver at 6:00 to head to the train for the trip to our drop off point.  At breakfast we met Bob and Bonni who were taking the same train, but going all the way to Agua Caliente and visiting Machu Picchu from there.</p>\n<p>When we arrived at the lobby to meet our guide, Bonni was on the phone with their guide.  It seems that there was a big accident on the way from Cusco and that their driver was going to be at last 30 minutes late, which would cause them to miss the train.  We volunteered to ask our guide to see if they could ride with us rather than riding in the taxi and everything worked out great.</p>\n<p>About halfway to the drop off point the rain stopped!  By the time we were ready to hit the trail we could actually see a few patches of blue sky peeking through the clouds.  This was looking like a good day for hiking after all!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5609b64275.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The one day hike has three main parts.  The first half is up hill where we gained over 1500 feet of elevation.  The next section is billed as being pretty flat, but that’s a lie.  It’s flat until the end where you have to climb up to the Sun gate.  From the Sun gate its all downhill, but that is maybe the last 1/8 of the 7.5 mile hike.</p>\n<p>We took it at a good pace and enjoyed most of the climb.  The scenery got better and better as we climbed higher.  We were mostly alone on the trail.  There was another pair of hikers that started just a bit before we did, and every so often we could catch sight of a larger group of 9 ahead of us on the trail.</p>\n<p>Soon we were high enough to look down on the trains as they passed with passengers heading to Agua Caliente.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7688cfa34d.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>One of the sites we got to see along our hike was the amazing Wiñay Wayra terraces.  It was beautiful to see from the distance.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/951f9765bb.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We thought it looked close, but somehow we kept walking and it never seemed to get any closer.  Finally we came down a few stairs then up a few stairs and stopped for a rest at the base of a waterfall. This was our time to gather our energy for the climb through Wiñay Wayra.  When we arrived the group of nine was just leaving, so we felt like we were doing a good job of keeping the pace.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f99a17158f.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>It looks a lot more daunting in person than it does in this photo.  And when we finally got to the base I started counting stairs. We were able to do about 60 at a time then we would have to stop and rest and catch our breath.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cf27962d9b.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The altitude definitely makes it harder work!  After 375 stairs we finally arrived at the terrace about 2/3 of the way up where we were able to go across and exit.  This was an amazing place for a picture.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1b80d92e43.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This was basically the end of the uphill part.  Both of us were extremely happy about that.  The next couple of hours were pretty easy and we made good time.  At some point along the way we even passed the larger group, saying our cheerful hellos as we passed.</p>\n<p>The first big surprise of the afternoon came when I came around a corner and in the middle of the bridge ahead of me was a Spectacle Bear! It saw me and quickly headed the other direction, while I fumbled to try to unclip my camera.  It moved off the path but Fernando advised us to just be quiet and wait.  Soon we saw it again climbing across the limb of the tree.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/72dc5d4753.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Our guide had told us about the bear earlier, and we knew that it is one of two bears in the world that are vegetarian.  He also said that this was only the second time in 25 years that he had seen one up close like this.</p>\n<p>A bit further along we arrived at the first part of the trail where we started to climb toward the Sun Gate.  Then we walked some more and came to the second part of the ascent, and then we arrived at the really hard part.  You can get a good idea of how steep this was and a view of my best side.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/dc42b23f24.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We thought we would be there but we still had 10 more minutes of walking and another bunch of stairs yet!  But when we finally got to the end it was so worth it!  And we had the view all to ourselves.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9d8fad126a.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>After taking in the view, we moved off to the side where we could site on a nice ledge and have a snack and continue to enjoy the view.  At this point the group of nine, that we had passed at some point during the day, came through the Sun Gate as well.  We exchanged greetings and discovered that the group was from Minnesota and Iowa.  This led to what part of Minnesota, what part of Iowa questions etc.  When I said that we had recently moved to Minneapolis from Decorah, I heard a voice say “Brad!?” And this was the second big surprise of the day.  Sure enough two of the People in this group were Kurt and Paula Meyer, fellow Luther alumnus and Paula had also been chair of the board of Regents when I served as faculty representative!  Amazing!!  Four Luther alums on the Inca Trail arriving at the Sun Gate within minutes of each other.  What are the chances?  Sounds like a data science question.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f987061642.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We discovered that we were staying at the same hotel that night, so we said our temporary good byes and we all headed down the final part of the trail.  Along the way down we had our third big surprise.  Jane was using her hiking poles and poked a viper.  Our guide advised us to hurry on by and not pause to take any pictures of the poison snake.  So we did.</p>\n<p>When we arrived at the bottom we still had to take a bus further down the mountain to Agua Caliente and then a short walk to our hotel, the Inkaterra.  At checkin we had the option of the 6:00 or the 8:00 seating for dinner.  We thought that maybe a dip in the hot springs (Agua Caliente) would be a good way to relax and rest up for the 8:00 dinner.  But by the time we had our complimentary Pisco Sour and chatted about our day with bob and Bonni, we decided that we didn’t have the energy to make it until 8:00.  So we switched to the 6:00 seating and we are so glad we did.  We were so tired and sore from our day of hiking that we were laying in bed reading by 8:00!</p>\n<p>Tomorrow we go back to Machu Picchu to get an up close look!</p>\n",

When we left the runway there were gasps of joy and cheers all over the plane.  There were also a lot of children making a lot of noise.  Jeez I sound like some cranky old man!  But we had barely leveled off before we were getting ready to land again.  It was a 40 minute flight but according to Maps a 9 hour drive!</p>\n<p>We were met by our friendly guide Fernando who will be with us for our time around Cusco.  He had water waiting for us — Hydration is important at altitude as well as a nice hot cup of Coca tea.  Also good for helping you get acclimated.

The whole base of the valley is filled with CORN FIELDS.  They have a huge variety of corn, purple, yellow, red, white and other colors, and the kernels are the size of marbles.

Thankfully they cook it in many different ways!  We checked in to the hotel and were immediately captivated by the Jacuzzi!</p>\n<p>Our schedule for the next day was for our guide to pick us up at the very reasonable hour of 8AM!  This day we had three amazing stops.  First was a textile demonstration at a women’s cooperative in Chinchero.  It was fascinating to see the hand weaving and how much work goes into making blankets, and belts, and sweaters, and yes ponchos.  it may not have been the smartest purchase I ever made, but if you see me wearing it around the cabin or the city you will know that I am wearing a hand made, waterproof, Alpaca poncho.

When the Spanish conquered the Inca king and subdued the people and stopped their work, think of the progress and the knowledge that was lost.  I’ve had this same thought in many parts of the world such as Pompeii. It makes me appreciate Google’s mission to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful.

Our guide explained that it would be like calling all of the Egyptians Pharos.  I’m sure we will learn a lot more of their history when we visit Machu Picchu.</p>\n<p>From the terraces we continued on to the Maras salt pans.  Here we saw 5000 small salt pans where people make salt that comes from a salty spring.  Deep in the Andes there is a giant salt deposit that this water works its way through, it then flows down this valley and through the many pans that people have created over the years to make salt.  Nowadays they actually make more money from tourism than salt, but I can’t help but think that is a short term setback until some marketer comes along and makes Peruvian Pink salt the next hot commodity for home gourmets.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/92e07bdfee.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>By the time we finished with all of this it was time for a late Peruvian lunch (2pm) which we enjoyed in the company of our guide and driver all the while just looking at the mountains that surrounded us on all sides.

I’m sure we will learn a lot more of their history when we visit Machu Picchu.\n\n\n\nFrom the terraces we continued on to the Maras salt pans.  Here we saw 5000 small salt pans where people make salt that comes from a salty spring.  Deep in the Andes there is a giant salt deposit that this water works its way through, it then flows down this valley and through the many pans that people have created over the years to make salt.  Nowadays they actually make more money from tourism than salt, but I can’t help but think that is a short term setback until some marketer comes along and makes Peruvian Pink salt the next hot commodity for home gourmets.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/92e07bdfee.jpg)\n\n\n\nBy the time we finished with all of this it was time for a late Peruvian lunch (2pm) which we enjoyed in the company of our guide and driver all the while just looking at the mountains that surrounded us on all sides.  It really is beautiful here in the Sacred Valley!\n\n\n\n![Misty Valley](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8b15b31f1e.jpg)\n\n\n\n![patchwork farms](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/12581b3502.jpg)\n\n\n\n![Terraces](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/3a71a870f7.jpg)\n",

If you said Singapore, you are correct. I will admit\nthat all of these facts come from our most excellent bike tour guide\nfrom Urban Adventures, so some of it could be &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; or just a\nsimple embellishment by someone who is very proud of their country. I\nhaven&rsquo;t fact checked any of it yet. But for as much as we saw some\npretty cool parts of Singapore today we heard a lot that really made us\nthink.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2595be5035.jpg\" alt=\"The Wall Street area of Singapore atnight.\"></p>\n<p>Maybe the banner picture gave it away before you even read the question?\nThe Marina Bay Sands hotel is the largest in Singapore and has some very\ndistinctive architecture. A ship on top of the three towers, the hotel\nis owned by the Sands hotel in Las Vegas. It&rsquo;s a massive hotel with a\ncasino and mall and botanical gardens and a very distinctive\narchitectural landmark of Singapore. Honestly, the Asian and\nMiddle-Eastern architecure we have seen on this trip make America seem\nreally boring. Hey, lets &ldquo;make American architecture great again!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>One of the reasons there is no homelessness is that the government\nprovides social housing. For as little as $30 / month for those who\nqualify you can rent a small 600 square foot apartment. To qualify for\nthe next level of social housing, you have to be married and at least 21\nyears old in order to qualify for social housing if your job is paying\nless than $90,000 / year. that may seem like a lot, but it is the\naverage income for Singapore. Once you are in at this level you can stay\nin for life if you want. Or you can even make improvements and sell your\nplace for a profit later when you want to move into even more expensive\nprivate housing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/07aa82e31b.jpg\" alt=\"They even have a special boat to scoop up the garbage that gets intothe river from the storm sewers\"></p>\n<p>The government is run like a large multi-national corporation. The\npresident makes 4 million a year and if you are elected you can expect\nto make about a million per year. Our guide put it this way, if you pay\npeanuts you will only get monkeys. Enough said.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9f54e5ad1e.jpg\" alt=\"Clarks Quay from the night boattour.\"></p>\n<p>Of course this is all true of a country that has a total population of\naround 5 million people and is only 278 square miles in size -- That is\na bit smaller than New York City. It is home to the world&rsquo;s second\nbusiest port and the world&rsquo;s number one airport. The government is run\nlike a business to make money and last year they were 9 billion in the\nblack. I think its easy for an American to look at this wistfully and\nsay what can we learn? Why can&rsquo;t we be more like this? But I think that\nis a pretty complicated question that brings into focus our freedoms and\nour history.

				"content_text": "\n# Post Bike Tour Quiz\n\nWhat country would you be in if I told you the following facts?\n\n-   90% of the people are home owners, 10% are renters and 0% are\n    homeless\n-   There is no unemployment\n-   Possession of a firearm is a capital offense\n-   Possession of drugs is a capital offense\n-   Universal helthcare\n-   You cannot buy alchohol (except in a bar) between the hours of 10pm\n    and 7am\n-   If you have a job lined up your are welcome\n-   If you are a refugee you are out of luck\n-   you will pay around 20% of your salary for social security and your\n    employer will contribute another 17% but you don't pay any income\n    tax.\n-   If you want to buy an Audi plan on spending around a half million\n    dollars\n-   You will not see any trash in the streets\n-   You can leave your bike unlocked or your purse on the table and\n    nobody will steal it.\n-   Home to the world's second busiest port\n\nIf you thought I was describing some \"commie socialist dictatorship\"\nyou would be wrong. If you said Singapore, you are correct. I will admit\nthat all of these facts come from our most excellent bike tour guide\nfrom Urban Adventures, so some of it could be \"fake news\" or just a\nsimple embellishment by someone who is very proud of their country. I\nhaven't fact checked any of it yet. But for as much as we saw some\npretty cool parts of Singapore today we heard a lot that really made us\nthink.\n\n![The Wall Street area of Singapore at\nnight.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2595be5035.jpg)\n\nMaybe the banner picture gave it away before you even read the question?\nThe Marina Bay Sands hotel is the largest in Singapore and has some very\ndistinctive architecture. A ship on top of the three towers, the hotel\nis owned by the Sands hotel in Las Vegas. It's a massive hotel with a\ncasino and mall and botanical gardens and a very distinctive\narchitectural landmark of Singapore. Honestly, the Asian and\nMiddle-Eastern architecure we have seen on this trip make America seem\nreally boring. Hey, lets \"make American architecture great again!\"\n\nOne of the reasons there is no homelessness is that the government\nprovides social housing. For as little as \\$30 / month for those who\nqualify you can rent a small 600 square foot apartment. To qualify for\nthe next level of social housing, you have to be married and at least 21\nyears old in order to qualify for social housing if your job is paying\nless than \\$90,000 / year. that may seem like a lot, but it is the\naverage income for Singapore. Once you are in at this level you can stay\nin for life if you want. Or you can even make improvements and sell your\nplace for a profit later when you want to move into even more expensive\nprivate housing.\n\n![They even have a special boat to scoop up the garbage that gets into\nthe river from the storm sewers](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/07aa82e31b.jpg)\n\nThe government is run like a large multi-national corporation. The\npresident makes 4 million a year and if you are elected you can expect\nto make about a million per year. Our guide put it this way, if you pay\npeanuts you will only get monkeys. Enough said.\n\n![Clarks Quay from the night boat\ntour.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9f54e5ad1e.jpg)\n\nOf course this is all true of a country that has a total population of\naround 5 million people and is only 278 square miles in size \\-- That is\na bit smaller than New York City. It is home to the world's second\nbusiest port and the world's number one airport. The government is run\nlike a business to make money and last year they were 9 billion in the\nblack. I think its easy for an American to look at this wistfully and\nsay what can we learn? Why can't we be more like this? But I think that\nis a pretty complicated question that brings into focus our freedoms and\nour history. I'd be happy to outlaw guns, but I'm not sure sure we\nshould turn away refugees and others in search of a better life. I\ndefinitely wouldn't want to pay half a million for my Audi! But I would\nsupport more use of mass transit and more biking in our cities.\n\n![The Marina Bay Sands resort by\nday](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/141e44dae8.jpg)\n\n![The Marina Bay Sands resort by\nnight](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ae4ae79b46.jpg)\n",

				"content_html": "<h1 id=\"progressive-trivia-champions\">Progressive Trivia Champions!</h1>\n<p>On our first day at sea we looked at the schedule of activities on board\nthe ship and Jane said, &ldquo;We should go take a bridge lesson.&rdquo; Having\ntried to learn bridge before I thought it sounded like a fun idea, maybe\nit would stick this time. So we showed up at the appointed time of 10AM\nand there were a bunch of us. We were among the youngest but certainly\nnot the only people in our age bracket. Our teacher was named Rhoda,\nclearly a longtime New Yorker. Also a lifelong teacher, she taught\nreading for most of her career. Most of the other beginners had never\neven played cards before so I have to give them credit for starting with\nBridge. All our nights of 500 were a definite advantage in the playing\nphase of Bridge. We didn&rsquo;t even start learning how to bid until the\nsecond lesson, but before we knew it we were adding high card points,\nlearning about 5 card major openings, Jacoby transfers, Staymen, forcing\nbids, no trump responses, and the other conventions of American Standard\nbridge bidding!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bfdb1eb615.jpg\" alt=\"This is Rhoda. She was a great teacher and really funny! If I canremember her little memory ditties for remembering all the bridgestrategy she taught us I might actually get goodsomeday.\"></p>\n<p>After bridge I was off to check out the cooking class for Indian Butter\nChicken, and Jane was headed to water color painting class. I turned out\nthat I had misread the time for the cooking class, but at least I got to\ntaste the result and get the recipe! I also wanted to check out the\ntrivia challenge and then sing with the Highseas Choir. (get it\nhigh-C&rsquo;s). I showed up at trivia at 12:15 and was invited to join a\ncouple from Canada to see if we could form a team, we were soon joined\nby Beverly (a librarian!) and so it was that on our first day we had a\nteam of four, which everyone else was at 8! Unsurprisingly we were\nsecond to last after the first day. However in this progressive trivia\nchallenge the points double each day. So on the next day I made Jane\njoin in, and little by little we grew our team, and our scores increased\nand we moved up the rankings. By the last day we were in second place!\nOne part of our strategy was to make use of the fact that you can\nrequest categories. I requested computer programming and cooking.

				"content_text": "\n# Progressive Trivia Champions!\n\nOn our first day at sea we looked at the schedule of activities on board\nthe ship and Jane said, \"We should go take a bridge lesson.\" Having\ntried to learn bridge before I thought it sounded like a fun idea, maybe\nit would stick this time. So we showed up at the appointed time of 10AM\nand there were a bunch of us. We were among the youngest but certainly\nnot the only people in our age bracket. Our teacher was named Rhoda,\nclearly a longtime New Yorker. Also a lifelong teacher, she taught\nreading for most of her career. Most of the other beginners had never\neven played cards before so I have to give them credit for starting with\nBridge. All our nights of 500 were a definite advantage in the playing\nphase of Bridge. We didn't even start learning how to bid until the\nsecond lesson, but before we knew it we were adding high card points,\nlearning about 5 card major openings, Jacoby transfers, Staymen, forcing\nbids, no trump responses, and the other conventions of American Standard\nbridge bidding!\n\n![This is Rhoda. She was a great teacher and really funny! If I can\nremember her little memory ditties for remembering all the bridge\nstrategy she taught us I might actually get good\nsomeday.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bfdb1eb615.jpg)\n\nAfter bridge I was off to check out the cooking class for Indian Butter\nChicken, and Jane was headed to water color painting class. I turned out\nthat I had misread the time for the cooking class, but at least I got to\ntaste the result and get the recipe! I also wanted to check out the\ntrivia challenge and then sing with the Highseas Choir. (get it\nhigh-C's). I showed up at trivia at 12:15 and was invited to join a\ncouple from Canada to see if we could form a team, we were soon joined\nby Beverly (a librarian!) and so it was that on our first day we had a\nteam of four, which everyone else was at 8! Unsurprisingly we were\nsecond to last after the first day. However in this progressive trivia\nchallenge the points double each day. So on the next day I made Jane\njoin in, and little by little we grew our team, and our scores increased\nand we moved up the rankings. By the last day we were in second place!\nOne part of our strategy was to make use of the fact that you can\nrequest categories. I requested computer programming and cooking. The\n\"programming\" question the next day was \"What does HTTP stand for?\".\nHa! Only two of us in the room knew the answer to that one. Its not\nreally a programming question if you ask me, but I'll take it.\n\nStarting in second place on the last day, we knew it was still almost\nanybody's game as the points that day were worth more than all the\nprevious days put together. But after the questions were in, and they\nread through the answers we realized that we had only missed two and\nmany other teams were not cheering too much as the answers were read.\nWhen it was all added up we won!\n\n![Our first place certificate, but we got a bag full of other Azamara\nswag; including a cup, a keychain, a t-shirt, a microfiber cloth\\... you\nget the idea.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/86b677d0cd.jpg)\n\nJane made three watercolor paintings on the ship during her painting\nlessons, and I think she should keep it up.

Our friends Ann and Jerry\ngot us very excited about seeing the temples of Bagan so this was the\nperfect opportunity to do that.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bda6310b39.jpg\" alt=\"sixteen people to a balloon in the early morning over the temples ofBagan\"></p>\n<p>Jane worked with Trufflepig travel agency to plan our days to get the\nmost out of the adventure. Which we definitely did as we were off the\nship early on our first morning in port and were were among the very\nlast handful of passengers to board less than an hour before we sailed\naway from Myanmar! Our first day was a fairly nice tour of Yangon. The\nmain attraction is the huge gold covered Schwedagon Pagoda. They were in\nthe midst of a project they do every five years to replace the gold\nplating on the dome of the pagoda. We saw families dressed in their\nfinest bringing a 10 by 10 inch plate of gold to place in a small cart\nthat would go by wire up to the dome where it would be put in place.\nThis must be the most expensive pagoda in the world, as the very tip of\nthe pagoda is encrusted with diamonds, rubies and sapphire gems worth\nmillions.</p>\n<p>The expense of the pagoda stands in stark contrast to everything around\nit. It seems that people are giving away their life savings to decorate\nthis place. Its a part of the culture that I would definitely like to\nunderstand more about. I should also point out that Myanmar is also\nfairly well endowed with gold mines, diamond mines as well as mines\ncontaining rubies and sapphires. But like many of our other stops there\nis also a huge amount of poverty.</p>\n<p>The flight to Bagan was about an hour aboard a propjet plane, and we\nwere met by our guide, Mr. Htay, and driver for our time in Bagan for\nthe short five minute ride to the Aureum Palace Hotel. A beautiful 5\nstar hotel where the bathroom in our villa was bigger than our entire\nstateroom on the ship! The dining and pool areas of the hotel overlook\nseveral smaller pagoda (pagodas? pagodi?). Although it was still only\naround 7pm we ate dinner at the hotel. The menu was a very international\nmenu including burmese, Thai, Italian, and American fare. Our server\nrecommended anything from the Thai menu as the chef was from Thailand\nand very good. I had the Pad Bai Kra Prao Gai -- something I&rsquo;m\ndetermined to cook at home. its a bit similar to Laarb but spicy instead\nof bright and fresh. Its ground chicken mixed with spices and spicy\nbasil served over rice.</p>\n<p>After dinner it was early to bed, partly because I was suffering from a\nnasty cold and partly because we knew we had a 4:40 alarm set to get up\nfor our balloon ride the next morning!

See the gallery at\nthe end of this post for a bunch of photos.</p>\n<p>We travelled to the launch site in a Carbus! The Carbus is a vehicle\nthat was made in Canada and used by the Allies in World War II. At the\nend of the war there were 206,000 of these vehicles in Burma but it was\ntoo expensive to ship them all back home so they were just left here.\nOver the years the burmese have restored them, replaced and engines, and\nused them for various purposes. The windows were open air, or you could\npull up some wooden shutters to block the early morning breeze which we\ndid since it was the first time since leaving home that we were a bit\nchilly.

As the sky\nbegan to turn gray in the east the safety briefing was over and it was\ntime to inflate the balloons! What a fascinating process, to watch them\nstart up fans and then run around inside the balloon making sure\neverything was in place. After the balloons were about three quarters\ninflated they started the burners and started shooting flames into the\nballoon, which very quickly became upright and ready for us to board!\nThere were sixteen passengers in four compartments of the basket. The\npilot, Fernando, was in the middle with his tanks of fuel and his ipads\nto show the wind speeds at various altitudes. it took a lot of hot air\nto get all seventeen of us into the air, but it was so gentle and\namazing that you didn&rsquo;t even realize you were leaving the ground.

It was all\nover too quickly when we landed (on our second attempt) in the middle of\na field.

Now he owns his own company\nin Spain, and spends five months of the year in Bagan doing balloon\nrides and five months in the south of france doing balloon rides. Quite\nan interesting life if you ask me!</p>\n<p>After the balloon we returned in our Carbus to the hotel where we\ncleaned up, had breakfast and then met our guide for our eBike tour of\nthe temples of Bagan. the eBike was a great way to explore the backroads\naround the temples.

But it was for a good reason, a Leopard.\nAfter many hours of bumping around the jungle in a jeep and seeing lots\nof different animals we still had not seen a leopard. We really didn&rsquo;t\nexpect to as it was hot and the middle of the day. Most of the sane\nleopards were hidden away napping on tree branches.

We saw some fun\nand beautiful sites along the way too. The Victoria train station was\nvery grand, and our stop at the cricket field was very entertaining.\nThere must have been at least 100 different cricket games going on\nsimultaneously. We watched as balls were hit across two, three, or even\nmore other games. It seemed like total chaos to me, but it was clear\nthat everyone was having a great time.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/0f5ddfb511.jpg\" alt=\"Cricket Chaos!\"></p>\n<p>Our tour also featured a stop for some street food! We went to food\nstand at the beach owned by Bihm Singh, where we tried a number of\ndifferent things. Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Dahi Ragda Puri. The Pani Pur\nand Dahi Ragda were both served in crisp little balls, where the cook\npunched a hole in the top and then filled the ball with delicious spicy\ningredients. The Sev was more like a nacho in that it was a flat crispy\nbit of dough with the ingredients piled high. The way you eat these is\nto pop it all in your mouth at once. Jane got a fabulous photo of me\ndemonstrating how to do this!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7033c6b91a.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrating the proper Pani Puri eatingtechnique.\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bcf41c1fe3.jpg\" alt=\"Making the Pani Puri\"></p>\n<p>As far as I could tell the whole place was run on some kind of honor\nsystem. I never saw an order being written down, and yet people were\neating all kinds of things chatting away and ordering and eating and\nchatting some more. like much of what we saw it seemed very cooperative\nand trusting amongst all of the participants.

The Victoria train station was\nvery grand, and our stop at the cricket field was very entertaining.\nThere must have been at least 100 different cricket games going on\nsimultaneously. We watched as balls were hit across two, three, or even\nmore other games. It seemed like total chaos to me, but it was clear\nthat everyone was having a great time.\n\n![Cricket Chaos!](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/0f5ddfb511.jpg)\n\nOur tour also featured a stop for some street food! We went to food\nstand at the beach owned by Bihm Singh, where we tried a number of\ndifferent things. Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Dahi Ragda Puri. The Pani Pur\nand Dahi Ragda were both served in crisp little balls, where the cook\npunched a hole in the top and then filled the ball with delicious spicy\ningredients. The Sev was more like a nacho in that it was a flat crispy\nbit of dough with the ingredients piled high. The way you eat these is\nto pop it all in your mouth at once. Jane got a fabulous photo of me\ndemonstrating how to do this!\n\n![Demonstrating the proper Pani Puri eating\ntechnique.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7033c6b91a.jpg)\n\n![Making the Pani Puri](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bcf41c1fe3.jpg)\n\nAs far as I could tell the whole place was run on some kind of honor\nsystem. I never saw an order being written down, and yet people were\neating all kinds of things chatting away and ordering and eating and\nchatting some more. like much of what we saw it seemed very cooperative\nand trusting amongst all of the participants. Such a different feel than\nyou get in so many places back home.\n\nI think the followup email from our guide sums up the day pretty well\nand since I've been struggling to put the day into words I'll just\nquote him.\n\n> You have picked your way through Dharavi's narrow, winding lanes, and\n> witnessed first hand the communal, enterprising spirit that allows so\n> many people to survive and thrive despite the many issues that they\n> face. We hope you've left having had some of your perceptions about\n> life here challenged.\n\nTo which I can only say, \"mission accomplished.\"\n",

Speaking of travel, we already love the fact that we\nwill be able to take our bags and make the short walk to the light rail\nto the airport. No parking, and no home maintenance worries while we are\naway.\n",

You may be able to view it <a href=\"https://portal.stretchinternet.com/lutheradmin/portal.htm?eventId=447260&amp;streamType=video\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Luke 24:   Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. 14 They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.</p>\n<p>The reading for today tells of a journey, and two friends talking about everything that had happened.  So, thats my plan for today.  Although I started my journey at Luther in Fall of 1982 as a skinny freshman,  I thought I would skip over 20 years and begin in the Fall of 2002.  After a successful career in industry, I felt called to come to Luther and share my experience.  I had come to campus and gone through the interview process, I’d given my interview talk to a packed house in Olin 112.  All I really remember from that talk was that the room was hot and as I looked over my audience I saw my revered former professor Steve Hubbard nodding off in the back row.</p>\n<p>Despite putting Steve to sleep I thought things went well, and now back in Plymouth MN Jane and I are waiting on pins and needles to hear something from Dean Craft.  Coming to Luther to teach had been my dream since I was a junior here at Luther back in 1985.  So you can imagine the anxiety level was pretty high.  After a few extra days of waiting we threw modern theology to the wind and prayed for the lord to send us a sign!  A burning bush, a cloud shaped like a Norse head, anything!  The next day I received an email from a colleague at the University of Minnesota.  Brad, just wanted to let you know that Gustavus is going to be starting a search for a tenure track position in computer science.  Wrong sign! I shouted.  A day later the phone rang and it was Bill Craft calling with the offer.</p>\n<p>In my ideas and creations post a week ago I wrote about 3 teachers on my journey  who inspired me, challenged me, and changed me.  My high school teacher Mr. Weinman who knew nothing about computers  but went way out of his way to encourage a couple of nerdy teens to teach themselves to program inspires me to bring teaching resources to other high school teachers.  My Luther Professor, Walt Will,  who inspired me to become a professor in the first place.  My master’s advisor, John Carlis  who challenged me to write a textbook when I told him I was going home to Luther College.</p>\n<p>Of course, the journey to Emmaus is not just about a couple guys on a hike, the next line of the reading tells of a stranger that joined them on their road and started chatting with them.  When I look back on my years here at Luther it will be the journeys and encounters with strangers  that became new colleagues and friends that I remember most.</p>\n<p>I have come to really love teaching students off campus.  My first  study away trip — a trip to Silicon Valley that I have done five times now — came about because an alumni wanted to teach a course on entrepreneurship. We hurriedly put the course together over November and December, and recruited 8 students&hellip; but over the Christmas break I added a last minute addition to the itinerary.  Jane and I were sitting at the Chefs table on a cruise ship and I was chatting with the stranger next to me.  I was telling him about the upcoming course which he thought sounded fantastic.  Then he dropped a bombshell, he said he worked at Pixar!  And, although visiting groups are not usually allowed he thought he could arrange something for us!  He was true to his word, and that visit turned out to be one of the real highlights of the course that year.</p>\n<p>Probably my favorite semester of all time at Luther will be the semester Jane and I spent with a dozen students in Malta.  We had 10 young women in the group who we very quickly began to refer to as our daughters.  We were very fortunate to get to travel with these students to Istanbul, Rome and Morocco.  It was in Marrakech , as we were walking down the street with one of our daughters that we were approached by a stranger.   I’ll give you two camels for your beautiful daughter he said with a smile and a wink.    Wait here! I said, I have 9 more daughters back at the Riad.  Some days I like to imagine the life I could have had as a camel rancher had I taken that stranger up on his offer.   A small postscript to this story:  After writing the rough draft of this talk I walked out to get the mail.  Only to find a thank you note from this very daughter.  It said “My husband and I are moving to Texas.  and I wouldn’t be ready for this next adventure if it hadn’t been for the journey’s with you two.”</p>\n<p>It was on that same trip to Morocco that we had an amazing day-long journey, from Fez through the middle Atlas Mountains  - where we had a snowball fight and fed the monkeys - to the edge of the Sahara, where we boarded camels and road into the desert.  Watching the sun set over the desert is one of the most beautiful and awe inspiring sights any of us had ever seen.  That night — with no WiFi or Cell service — our Berber hosts cooked us a Tagine of beef and we sat outside with them where they played drums and sang traditional Berber songs for us.  We treated them to a rendition of &ldquo;To Luther&rdquo; and We will Rock You!  That night changed us all.</p>\n<p>Sometimes when you are on a journey, it is the unplanned things that can surprise you the most.  During our stop at Ait Ben Haddou we made a dinner time decision to extend our stay so that we could visit the Ksar - The fortified city.  At breakfast, Mohammed, the owner of the Hotel Bagdhad Cafe was happy to line up a guide, also named Mohammed, for us at the last minute, giving him an unconditional recommendation as the best guide in town.</p>\n<p>At about the midway point of our climb through the Ksar our guide stopped outside his own house. &ldquo;You are welcome here&rdquo; he said. This is a phrase we had heard everywhere in Morocco from many different people.  It had a much different feel than &ldquo;welcome to my place.” it is at once more personal, more authentic, and unconditional.  In a place where we wondered whether we really would be welcome we found it very comforting.  Maybe thats a phrase we could think about adopting here at Luther.</p>\n<p>Towards the end of the tour we came upon a mosque which is still in daily use. Right next to the mosque was a synagogue, no longer in use. The history of the Berber people is very old, and interesting. At one time the majority of the Berber&rsquo;s were Jewish, then for a time they were Christian, but they have been Muslim for a long time.  The result for the Berbers is that they are peaceful, and very tolerant.  We want to get along with all people Mohammed told us. He went on, the problems in the world today are caused by three things: money, politics, and crazy people &ndash; Crazy Jews, Crazy Muslims, and Crazy Christians. Most people are good and peaceful people, its a shame the crazy people have to ruin it.</p>\n<p>So, as I reach the end of my journey as a Luther faculty member I have much to be thankful for and I look forward to the future with excitement.

I told him about my career path and that I too was making a change and was on my way back after two days of meetings with my new team at Google.

				"content_html": "<p>As this will be my final Ideas and Creations contribution I hope you will indulge me in a little look back over my relationship with Luther College and the teachers and professors that have made me who I am today.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/d24cce6534.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The first person I want to mention is the man in the picture &ndash; Charlie Weinman,  with the hairstyle and the vest you might guess this picture comes from the early 80&rsquo;s.  Mr. Weinman taught typing and shorthand at Luverne High School. The picture shows him in a typical pose, and I can hear his exasperated sigh at my inability to keep my eyes off the keyboard as I worked on my &ldquo;perfect paragraphs.&rdquo;  Mr Weinman was the advisor to the annual staff as well, and his favorite saying, which I heard often, was “If you want something done right, ask a busy person”  Somewhere along the way Mr. Weinman noticed that  one of the reasons I was always so busy was because my friend and I spent an inordinate amount of time messing around on the Apple II computers our high school had just purchased.  We were teaching ourselves to program and trading games on cassette tapes. He made it his mission to help and encourage us — with the programming part.  On weekends he would drive us to programming contests all around Southwest Minnesota.  He eventually created the first programming class at the high school.  The deal was that my friends and I could take the class so we could get credit and have it on our transcript, but we were to sit in the back and keep quiet &ndash; unless he asked for our help.</p>\n<p>As I look back on it Mr Weinman was modeling a key aspect of a Luther education — life long learning.  He also demonstrated to us  with great humor and humility that teachers don&rsquo;t always have all the answers.  This was a good lesson, as even today in my final semester I&rsquo;m faced every day with the fact that I don&rsquo;t have all the answers when teaching machine learning or internet programming.  The world of computer science moves far to quickly for any of us to know it all, and we must be prepared to be lifelong learners if we are going to succeed in this field.</p>\n<h2 id=\"walt-will\">Walt Will</h2>\n<p>When I arrived at Luther in the fall of 1982 I became a Norseman.  It was only year two for the Norsemen, but the foundations that were laid for this group in 1981 are still strong today.  Norsemen may be the only connection I have to some classmates, but I would still consider them my brothers.  It was probably my classmate,  Tim Peter, who came walking down the hall of first floor Ylvi encouraging those of us who were clueless to come to tryouts for this relatively unknown group!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/772d2330ba.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>As a computer science major I was fortunate to take the majority of my classes from Dr. Walt Will.  Walt was my professor, my advisor and a great role model.   He had a wonderful dry humor and an endless supply of patience to answer my endless stream of questions in class or to just sit in his office and talk about computer science and life in general.  In the spirit of life long learning we always knew that Walt was just ahead of us (if only by a few days)  in our journey through this new field of computer science together.</p>\n<p>Walt was such a huge influence that when people would ask me about my career goals I would say &ldquo;I want to come back to Luther and take Walt Will&rsquo;s job.”  That sounds a little harsh to my older self, but I meant it as the highest possible compliment to Walt.   I really felt that success in life would be to have the kind of impact on other students that Walt had on us. After 18 years in the computer science industry, it was ultimately Walt who paved the way for my return to Luther as a faculty member.   I remember a phone call with Walt when he told me he would be only too happy to move back to the Math department to create a position in computer science in 2003.  As I started my new career as a professor I was very lucky to have Walt down the hall to talk with and get advice.

Big classes, registration lines that stretched down the stairs and around the block, professors that closed the doors to their office, it was all very foreign.

I was fortunate enough to take a class from John which changed everything and led to him becoming my masters advisor and friend.

				"content_text": "\nAs this will be my final Ideas and Creations contribution I hope you will indulge me in a little look back over my relationship with Luther College and the teachers and professors that have made me who I am today.\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/d24cce6534.jpg)\n\n\n\nThe first person I want to mention is the man in the picture -- Charlie Weinman,  with the hairstyle and the vest you might guess this picture comes from the early 80's.  Mr. Weinman taught typing and shorthand at Luverne High School. The picture shows him in a typical pose, and I can hear his exasperated sigh at my inability to keep my eyes off the keyboard as I worked on my \"perfect paragraphs.\"  Mr Weinman was the advisor to the annual staff as well, and his favorite saying, which I heard often, was “If you want something done right, ask a busy person”  Somewhere along the way Mr. Weinman noticed that  one of the reasons I was always so busy was because my friend and I spent an inordinate amount of time messing around on the Apple II computers our high school had just purchased.  We were teaching ourselves to program and trading games on cassette tapes. He made it his mission to help and encourage us — with the programming part.  On weekends he would drive us to programming contests all around Southwest Minnesota.  He eventually created the first programming class at the high school.  The deal was that my friends and I could take the class so we could get credit and have it on our transcript, but we were to sit in the back and keep quiet -- unless he asked for our help.\n\n\n\nAs I look back on it Mr Weinman was modeling a key aspect of a Luther education — life long learning.  He also demonstrated to us  with great humor and humility that teachers don't always have all the answers.  This was a good lesson, as even today in my final semester I'm faced every day with the fact that I don't have all the answers when teaching machine learning or internet programming.  The world of computer science moves far to quickly for any of us to know it all, and we must be prepared to be lifelong learners if we are going to succeed in this field.\n\n\n\n## Walt Will\n\nWhen I arrived at Luther in the fall of 1982 I became a Norseman.  It was only year two for the Norsemen, but the foundations that were laid for this group in 1981 are still strong today.  Norsemen may be the only connection I have to some classmates, but I would still consider them my brothers.  It was probably my classmate,  Tim Peter, who came walking down the hall of first floor Ylvi encouraging those of us who were clueless to come to tryouts for this relatively unknown group!\n\n\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/772d2330ba.jpg)\n\n\n\nAs a computer science major I was fortunate to take the majority of my classes from Dr. Walt Will.  Walt was my professor, my advisor and a great role model.   He had a wonderful dry humor and an endless supply of patience to answer my endless stream of questions in class or to just sit in his office and talk about computer science and life in general.  In the spirit of life long learning we always knew that Walt was just ahead of us (if only by a few days)  in our journey through this new field of computer science together.\n\n\n\nWalt was such a huge influence that when people would ask me about my career goals I would say \"I want to come back to Luther and take Walt Will's job.”  That sounds a little harsh to my older self, but I meant it as the highest possible compliment to Walt.   I really felt that success in life would be to have the kind of impact on other students that Walt had on us. After 18 years in the computer science industry, it was ultimately Walt who paved the way for my return to Luther as a faculty member.   I remember a phone call with Walt when he told me he would be only too happy to move back to the Math department to create a position in computer science in 2003.  As I started my new career as a professor I was very lucky to have Walt down the hall to talk with and get advice.

I&rsquo;m leaving a tenured faculty position, at a college I love dearly to start a new company.  Here is what I take away.</p>\n<p>We heard the following from a lot of different people: &ldquo;follow your passion!&rdquo;  Well, I admit I&rsquo;ve told my students this many many times (although I could write a full post on the perils of telling 19 year olds that they need a passion.)  But I have to say that for as much as I enjoy teaching at Luther College,  <a href=\"http://runestoneinteractive.org\">Runestone Interactive</a> has definitely become a <strong>passion.</strong>  Runestone has grown from a small project for 30 Luther students few years ago, to supporting over 20,000 students each day from over 600 institutions around the world. This growth has all happened through word of mouth.  No advertising, No booths at trade shows, no sales force, no full time development team!  I really think that Runestone could be 2,000,000 students a day with focus and full time effort. &ndash; Yes, former students, that is what I think about in the shower in the morning!</p>\n<p>The separation incentive offered by Luther gives me the opportunity to start a new company, incorporating what I learned from all the mistakes I made the first time around with Net Perceptions, and all of the experience I&rsquo;ve gained in the last 15 years of teaching.  It gives me <strong>one year</strong> to figure out if there is a business model that will keep the basic features and the books of Runestone free to everyone, while allowing me to build a small business that pays a salary, and hopefully allows me to bring others on board to work on this with me.  It allows me to (1) follow a passion, (2) make the world a better place and (3) to play my part in &ldquo;righting the wrong&rdquo; that is textbook publishing today.  Yes, $300 for a paperback textbook is a wrong!  Wow, count them, that is three awesome reasons to start a company!</p>\n<h2 id=\"democratizing-textbooks-for-the-21supstsup-century\">Democratizing Textbooks for the 21<!-- raw HTML omitted -->st<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Century</h2>\n<p>In our discussions of Guy Kawasaki&rsquo;s books during JTerm we talked about companies needing a mantra.  I think that the Mantra for Runestone is &ldquo;Democratizing textbooks for the 21<!-- raw HTML omitted -->st<!-- raw HTML omitted --> century&rdquo;. This could be another whole post, but I&rsquo;ll just say that there is a huge need for computer scientists and there are a lot of well meaning, (but potentially under-prepared) teachers out there who we can help teach computer science.  This is true at the high-school level where computer science is getting traction again, as well as many small colleges where it is almost impossible to find a computer science PhD who is willing to work for what small colleges can pay.</p>\n<p>The second piece of Runestone is in the interactive nature of the books.  Textbooks should not be static, read-only, words.  Textbooks in the 21<!-- raw HTML omitted -->st<!-- raw HTML omitted --> century should engage the reader in interactive learning.  Textbooks should also give instructors insight into what their students understand and what their students are struggling with&hellip; Textbooks should help answer the question &ldquo;How can I maximize my time in the classroom today?&rdquo;</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-uncomfortable\">Get Uncomfortable</h2>\n<p>We heard a lot about seeking opportunities that make you uncomfortable.  It is through these uncomfortable experiences that you grow.  For the last 15 years this has happened through teaching (especially new courses), and traveling to new places (many times with students) and experiencing new cultures.  Leaving my faculty position &ndash; where I have almost total job security &ndash; is definitely a move in an uncomfortable direction.  Especially for someone over the age of 50. But, I am convinced this is the right thing to do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creating-a-culture-charting-your-own-course\">Creating a culture, charting your own course</h2>\n<p>We heard from a lot of people that had worked in both large and small companies about how great it was to be part of a small organization. in a startup, everything you do is important.  From making the coffee in the morning, to setting strategic direction.  <strong>I get that</strong>. I remember those early days from Net Perceptions.  I miss those days. I miss that sense of ownership for the whole enterprise. The &ldquo;shared governance&rdquo; model used by most small colleges is about as far from agile as you can get.</p>\n<p>This course reminded me, yet again, why I admire Jeff Bezos and the culture he has built at Amazon.  I was blown away that all of the young people we spoke with at Amazon understood and could talk about many, if not all of,  the 14 leadership principles.  If you don&rsquo;t know them here they are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Amazon&rsquo;s Leadership Principles</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Customer Obsession</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ownership</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Invent and Simplify</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Are Right, a Lot</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learn and be Curious</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hire and Develop the Best</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Insist on the Highest Standards</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Think Big</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bias for Action</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Frugality</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Earn Trust</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Dive Deep</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Deliver Results</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can get more detail on each of them <a href=\"https://www.amazon.jobs/principles\">here</a>.  But I can only fantasize what a great company Runestone would be if I put these into action.  I also think that higher-ed could benefit from all of these principles, but the conditions are so hard to make this happen!</p>\n<p>So as I finish up this post, I have a week until Spring Semester classes begin.  Am I sad that this is my last semester?  Of course! Luther College is such an integral part of my life &ndash; I&rsquo;m an alumni, a parent of an alumni, a faculty member, and a donor.  I&rsquo;ll only be losing one of those four tags.  I look forward to finding new ways that I can serve the college in the future.  I&rsquo;ll also miss the students and all of the energy they bring.  I&rsquo;ll miss watching them grow and develop into the successful entrepreneurs, developers, and managers that so many of them have become.  In the meantime, I&rsquo;m going to enjoy my final semester to the max.  I get to teach two of my favorite classes, and I&rsquo;m eliminating non-essential committee work to go out on a high note!</p>\n",

I think that the Mantra for Runestone is \"Democratizing textbooks for the 21<sup>st</sup> century\". This could be another whole post, but I'll just say that there is a huge need for computer scientists and there are a lot of well meaning, (but potentially under-prepared) teachers out there who we can help teach computer science.  This is true at the high-school level where computer science is getting traction again, as well as many small colleges where it is almost impossible to find a computer science PhD who is willing to work for what small colleges can pay.  \n\n\n\nThe second piece of Runestone is in the interactive nature of the books.  Textbooks should not be static, read-only, words.  Textbooks in the 21<sup>st</sup> century should engage the reader in interactive learning.  Textbooks should also give instructors insight into what their students understand and what their students are struggling with... Textbooks should help answer the question \"How can I maximize my time in the classroom today?\"\n\n\n\n## Get Uncomfortable\n\nWe heard a lot about seeking opportunities that make you uncomfortable.  It is through these uncomfortable experiences that you grow.  For the last 15 years this has happened through teaching (especially new courses), and traveling to new places (many times with students) and experiencing new cultures.  Leaving my faculty position -- where I have almost total job security -- is definitely a move in an uncomfortable direction.  Especially for someone over the age of 50. But, I am convinced this is the right thing to do.\n\n\n\n## Creating a culture, charting your own course\n\nWe heard from a lot of people that had worked in both large and small companies about how great it was to be part of a small organization. in a startup, everything you do is important.  From making the coffee in the morning, to setting strategic direction.  **I get that**. I remember those early days from Net Perceptions.  I miss those days. I miss that sense of ownership for the whole enterprise. The \"shared governance\" model used by most small colleges is about as far from agile as you can get.\n\n\n\nThis course reminded me, yet again, why I admire Jeff Bezos and the culture he has built at Amazon.  I was blown away that all of the young people we spoke with at Amazon understood and could talk about many, if not all of,  the 14 leadership principles.  If you don't know them here they are:\n\n\n\n* Amazon's Leadership Principles\n\n\n\n\t* Customer Obsession\n\n\t* Ownership\n\n\t* Invent and Simplify\n\n\t* Are Right, a Lot\n\n\t* Learn and be Curious\n\n\t* Hire and Develop the Best\n\n\t* Insist on the Highest Standards\n\n\t* Think Big\n\n\t* Bias for Action\n\n\t* Frugality\n\n\t* Earn Trust\n\n\t* Dive Deep\n\n\t* Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit\n\n\t* Deliver Results\n\n\n\nYou can get more detail on each of them [here](https://www.amazon.jobs/principles).  But I can only fantasize what a great company Runestone would be if I put these into action.  I also think that higher-ed could benefit from all of these principles, but the conditions are so hard to make this happen!\n\n\n\nSo as I finish up this post, I have a week until Spring Semester classes begin.  Am I sad that this is my last semester?  Of course! Luther College is such an integral part of my life -- I'm an alumni, a parent of an alumni, a faculty member, and a donor.  I'll only be losing one of those four tags.  I look forward to finding new ways that I can serve the college in the future.  I'll also miss the students and all of the energy they bring.  I'll miss watching them grow and develop into the successful entrepreneurs, developers, and managers that so many of them have become.  In the meantime, I'm going to enjoy my final semester to the max.  I get to teach two of my favorite classes, and I'm eliminating non-essential committee work to go out on a high note!\n",

I remember that when Net Perceptions officially\nlaunched our product it was at the Agenda conference in Phoenix Arizona.\nThey were also launching the Palm Pilot at that same conference. What I\nremember most about this was the brilliant marketing they did. First,\nthey had preloaded a bunch of Palm Pilots with the conference schedule.\nSecond, they had a bunch of &ldquo;old ladies&rdquo; demonstrating how easy they\nwere to use. They showed you the Grafiti writing system, how to add\nmeetings, and they took your credit card with the promise that you could\nuse one for the duration of the conference and if you didn&rsquo;t want it\nafter that they wouldn&rsquo;t charge your card. I&rsquo;m pretty sure every\nsingle person kept theirs. This was the first of a very long line of\nPDAs that I have owned over the years.

Sadly I didn't seen one at the computer\nhistory museum.\n\n![image](/images/ComputerHistory/IBMPC.png)\n\n## Apple Lisa and Macintosh\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/848785628d.jpg)\n\nJay also had a Lisa in his home office! I couldn't wait to graduate and\nmake some money so I could have one of my own. Of course by the time\nJane and I got married just a year later the Lisa was a thing of the\npast and so we got a Mac Plus instead! I still have this computer in my\noffice at Luther. It still boots from a floppy and runs Microsoft's\nflight simulator.\n\n## The CDC 6600\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1462fe4082.jpg)\n\nWhen I started work at Control Data's Energy Management Systems\ndivision in 1986 I was awed by the giant cooled computer room. There\nwere lots of giant water cooled Cyber computers in there for the newer\ncustomers, but amongst all of those newere Cybers was this little old\nCDC6600 computer than was running an older version of the software. If\nit scares you that our electrical grid was controlled by one of these\ndon't worry, they were solid work horses for many years. What I\nremember most about the 6600 was that there was a little program that\nmade the two CRT's look like eyes, and then one of them would wink at\nyou.\n\n## Symbolics Lisp Machine\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c20885f36d.jpg)\n\nAfter a couple of years at CDC I managed to manuever my way into an AI\ngroup. A lot of high-end AI programming was done in Lisp in those days\nand the Symbolics was *the* machine to have if you really wanted to do\nit.\n\n## Silicon Graphics\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/41a2c0ea87.jpg)\n\nShortly after the Symbolics we switched to running more general purpose\nUnix workstations. CDC was reselling SGI computers under the label of\n\"Personal Iris\" I taught myself some very early graphics in what\neventually became OpenGL on these machines. This began a life long love\nof using Unix. I spent many extra hours on the Iris compiling emacs and\nother early open source programs.\n\n## The Palm Pilot\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/112219e461.jpg)\n\nThe last bit of nostalgia I captured at the museum was this first\ngeneration Palm Pilot! I remember that when Net Perceptions officially\nlaunched our product it was at the Agenda conference in Phoenix Arizona.\nThey were also launching the Palm Pilot at that same conference. What I\nremember most about this was the brilliant marketing they did. First,\nthey had preloaded a bunch of Palm Pilots with the conference schedule.\nSecond, they had a bunch of \"old ladies\" demonstrating how easy they\nwere to use. They showed you the Grafiti writing system, how to add\nmeetings, and they took your credit card with the promise that you could\nuse one for the duration of the conference and if you didn't want it\nafter that they wouldn't charge your card. I'm pretty sure every\nsingle person kept theirs. This was the first of a very long line of\nPDAs that I have owned over the years. I could probably do a whole post\njust on those.\n\nVisiting the Computer History Museum was educational, and a great trip\ndown memory lane for me. If you are ever in Mountain View and have a few\nhours I would highly recommend you plan to spend couple hours exploring!\n",

She made a whole bunch of assumptions about what we were like because we were a “christian” college.

Yes we are a “christian” college but not a fundamentalist college.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Embrace Diversity</strong> — I think you might be hard pressed to find a major with more diversity than CS.

It is OK for us to care about outcomes and careers and helping students find their calling and vocation in life.

				"title": "Fending Off “Day 2”  at Luther College",
				"content_html": "<p>I’m a fan of Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon,  whether its because he “got it” and was the first customer of Net Perceptions or because of his fascination with space or just because I admire him as a leader.  It doesn’t matter, I pay attention to what he has to say on a lot of things.</p>\n<p>The building at Amazon where Jeff has his office is called Day 1, even when he moves to a new office he brings the name of the building with him.  This is because he is always reminding himself to act like it is Day 1.</p>\n<p>This morning I read his latest letter to the shareholders of Amazon in which he was asked what does Day 2 look like. Here is his short answer:  “Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And <strong>that</strong> is why it is <strong>always</strong> Day 1.”</p>\n<p>In the letter he goes on to expand upon his ideas for how to fend off Day 2.  I’ll give you his one sentence synopsis, and in the rest of this post I would like to share with you how I translate his ideas into the context of Luther College.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here’s a starter pack of essentials for Day 1 defense: customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and high-velocity decision making.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Its not a surprise that customer obsession is number one on his list.  The amazon mission statement is pretty simple:  &ldquo;Our vision is to be earth&rsquo;s most customer-centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online.&rdquo;  I am not a fan of viewing students as customers, but I think student success is a good substitute.  So here is a lightly edited version of what Bezos had to say,  plugging in student success where appropriate.</p>\n<h2 id=\"obsess-about-student-success\">Obsess About Student Success</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see student success.  A <strong>student success</strong> obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that can happen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That statement pretty well sums up the lens through which I view the discussion we have had on campus lately regarding program eliminations and reductions and how we evolve as a liberal arts college in the 21st century.  We have to be bold and willing to try new programs at Luther.  But we must equally be willing to accept that something we have tried did not work as well as we had hoped, and when that happens we should move our resources somewhere else.  If we are student success focused then we can view moving on as a victory <strong>for the students</strong> rather than a defeat for a particular <strong>program of study.</strong> If we are <strong>student success</strong> focused then this frees us from endless debate about whether a particular subject is “central to the liberal arts.”</p>\n<p>Its easy to view starting a new program as “planting a seed,” and as we heard over the past few weeks, when we do try a new program we must commit to making that program a success.  As teachers and mentors I think we are always planting seeds in our students.  Some of those seeds sprout quickly others need to be protected an nourished patiently over the course of three or four years.  At the end of an emotionally draining faculty meeting Dean Krause gave us a great reminder that that we can and must challenge our best students as well as our weakest students.</p>\n<p>Of course we could probably have a long discussion about what it means for our students to be successful.  Some might define it in terms of outcomes, or jobs at the end of four years.  Others might define it in terms of creating a “well rounded” person.  For me,  this translates into my classes in a different way.  I have a pretty minimal syllabus with a set of goals and topics for the semester.  How fast or how slow I go, how many of the topics I cover depends on the students in the course that semester.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resist-proxies\">Resist Proxies</h2>\n<p>As organizations get larger and more complex there is a tendency to manage to proxies.  Bezos mentions two proxies in his letter than resonate strongly.  Process and Surveys.  Here is what Bezos has to say about process:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you’re doing the process right. Gulp. It’s not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, “Well, we followed the process.” A more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process. The process is not the thing. It’s always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bezos goes on to talk about a second dangerous proxy:  market research and surveys.  We cannot let surveys become proxies for our students, faculty, staff or alumni.  Good teachers and administrators <strong>deeply</strong> understand their students and programs. They spend tremendous energy developing that intuition. They study and understand many anecdotes rather than only the averages you’ll find on surveys.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m not against beta testing or surveys. But you, the product or service owner, must understand the customer, have a vision, and love the offering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"embrace-external-trends\">Embrace External Trends</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won’t or can’t embrace powerful trends quickly. If you fight them, you’re probably fighting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These big trends are not that hard to spot (they get talked and written about a lot), but they can be strangely hard for large organizations to embrace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What big trends are we fighting against right now?  Here are a few I might suggest we think about, I’m sure others can add to this list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The trend to develop alternative revenue sources?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The trend toward online learning?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A more diverse student population?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"high-velocity-decision-making\">High Velocity Decision Making</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Day 2 companies make high- <strong>quality</strong> decisions, but they make high-quality decisions <strong>slowly</strong>. To keep the energy and dynamism of Day 1, you have to somehow make high-quality, <strong>high-velocity</strong> decisions. Easy for start-ups and very challenging for large organizations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>First, never use a one-size-fits-all decision-making process. Many decisions are reversible, two-way doors. Those decisions can use a light-weight process. For those, so what if you’re wrong?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Second, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow. Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Third, use the phrase “disagree and commit.” This phrase will save a lot of time. If you have conviction on a particular direction even though there’s no consensus, it’s helpful to say, “Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?” By the time you’re at this point, no one can know the answer for sure, and you’ll probably get a quick yes.  This isn’t one way. If you’re the boss, you should do this too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fourth, recognize true <strong>misalignment</strong> issues early and escalate them <strong>immediately</strong>. Sometimes teams have different objectives and fundamentally different views. They are not aligned. No amount of discussion, no number of meetings will resolve that deep misalignment. Without escalation, the default dispute resolution mechanism for this scenario is exhaustion. Whoever has more stamina carries the decision.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You’ve worn me down” is an awful decision-making process. It’s slow and de-energizing. Go for quick escalation instead – it’s better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think we can learn from all of these examples.  But I especially worry about the second and fourth with respect to our work in faculty governance.</p>\n<p>Note:  I originally wrote this post for Luther&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.luther.edu/ideas-creations-blog/?story_id=760534\">Ideas and Creations blog</a></p>\n<p>If you are interested you can find the full text of Bezo’s letter here:  <a href=\"https://www.recode.net/2017/4/12/15274220/jeff-bezos-amazon-shareholders-letter-day-2-disagree-and-commit\">This is the Jeff Bezos playbook for preventing Amazon’s demise - Recode</a></p>\n",

I’ll give you his one sentence synopsis, and in the rest of this post I would like to share with you how I translate his ideas into the context of Luther College.  \n\n\n\n> Here’s a starter pack of essentials for Day 1 defense: customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and high-velocity decision making.  \n\n\n\nIts not a surprise that customer obsession is number one on his list.  The amazon mission statement is pretty simple:  \"Our vision is to be earth's most customer-centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online.\"  I am not a fan of viewing students as customers, but I think student success is a good substitute.  So here is a lightly edited version of what Bezos had to say,  plugging in student success where appropriate.\n\n\n\n## Obsess About Student Success\n\n\n\n> Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see student success.  A **student success** obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that can happen.  \n\n\n\nThat statement pretty well sums up the lens through which I view the discussion we have had on campus lately regarding program eliminations and reductions and how we evolve as a liberal arts college in the 21st century.  We have to be bold and willing to try new programs at Luther.  But we must equally be willing to accept that something we have tried did not work as well as we had hoped, and when that happens we should move our resources somewhere else.  If we are student success focused then we can view moving on as a victory **for the students** rather than a defeat for a particular **program of study.** If we are **student success** focused then this frees us from endless debate about whether a particular subject is “central to the liberal arts.”\n\n\n\nIts easy to view starting a new program as “planting a seed,” and as we heard over the past few weeks, when we do try a new program we must commit to making that program a success.  As teachers and mentors I think we are always planting seeds in our students.  Some of those seeds sprout quickly others need to be protected an nourished patiently over the course of three or four years.  At the end of an emotionally draining faculty meeting Dean Krause gave us a great reminder that that we can and must challenge our best students as well as our weakest students.\n\n\n\nOf course we could probably have a long discussion about what it means for our students to be successful.  Some might define it in terms of outcomes, or jobs at the end of four years.  Others might define it in terms of creating a “well rounded” person.  For me,  this translates into my classes in a different way.  I have a pretty minimal syllabus with a set of goals and topics for the semester.  How fast or how slow I go, how many of the topics I cover depends on the students in the course that semester.\n\n\n\n## Resist Proxies\n\n\n\nAs organizations get larger and more complex there is a tendency to manage to proxies.  Bezos mentions two proxies in his letter than resonate strongly.  Process and Surveys.  Here is what Bezos has to say about process:\n\n\n\n> A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you’re doing the process right. Gulp. It’s not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, “Well, we followed the process.” A more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process. The process is not the thing. It’s always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us?  \n\n\n\nBezos goes on to talk about a second dangerous proxy:  market research and surveys.  We cannot let surveys become proxies for our students, faculty, staff or alumni.  Good teachers and administrators **deeply** understand their students and programs. They spend tremendous energy developing that intuition. They study and understand many anecdotes rather than only the averages you’ll find on surveys. \n\n\n\n> I’m not against beta testing or surveys. But you, the product or service owner, must understand the customer, have a vision, and love the offering.  \n\n\n\n## Embrace External Trends\n\n\n\n> The outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won’t or can’t embrace powerful trends quickly. If you fight them, you’re probably fighting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind.  \n\n\n\n> These big trends are not that hard to spot (they get talked and written about a lot), but they can be strangely hard for large organizations to embrace.  \n\n\n\nWhat big trends are we fighting against right now?  Here are a few I might suggest we think about, I’m sure others can add to this list.\n\n\n\n* The trend to develop alternative revenue sources?\n\n* The trend toward online learning?\n\n* A more diverse student population?\n\n\n\n## High Velocity Decision Making\n\n\n\n> Day 2 companies make high- **quality** decisions, but they make high-quality decisions **slowly**. To keep the energy and dynamism of Day 1, you have to somehow make high-quality, **high-velocity** decisions. Easy for start-ups and very challenging for large organizations.   \n\n\n\n> First, never use a one-size-fits-all decision-making process. Many decisions are reversible, two-way doors. Those decisions can use a light-weight process. For those, so what if you’re wrong?   \n\n\n\n> Second, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow. Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.  \n\n\n\n> Third, use the phrase “disagree and commit.” This phrase will save a lot of time. If you have conviction on a particular direction even though there’s no consensus, it’s helpful to say, “Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?” By the time you’re at this point, no one can know the answer for sure, and you’ll probably get a quick yes.  This isn’t one way. If you’re the boss, you should do this too.  \n\n\n\n> Fourth, recognize true **misalignment** issues early and escalate them **immediately**. Sometimes teams have different objectives and fundamentally different views. They are not aligned. No amount of discussion, no number of meetings will resolve that deep misalignment. Without escalation, the default dispute resolution mechanism for this scenario is exhaustion. Whoever has more stamina carries the decision.   \n\n\n\n> “You’ve worn me down” is an awful decision-making process. It’s slow and de-energizing. Go for quick escalation instead – it’s better.  \n\n\n\nI think we can learn from all of these examples.  But I especially worry about the second and fourth with respect to our work in faculty governance.\n\n\n\nNote:  I originally wrote this post for Luther's [Ideas and Creations blog](http://www.luther.edu/ideas-creations-blog/?story_id=760534)\n\n\n\nIf you are interested you can find the full text of Bezo’s letter here:  [This is the Jeff Bezos playbook for preventing Amazon’s demise - Recode](https://www.recode.net/2017/4/12/15274220/jeff-bezos-amazon-shareholders-letter-day-2-disagree-and-commit)\n",

				"content_html": "<p><img src=\"../images/NZ/bag_end.jpg\" alt=\"Bag End\"></p>\n<p>For as little as I wanted to go to the stinky spa yesterday, Jane wanted to go to Hobbiton today even less.  She&rsquo;s not a big Lord of the Rings Fan.  But our guide told us that nearly 30% of the people who visit Hobbiton have never seen even one of movies nor have they ready any of the books.  Having seen all of the movies more than once and read the books, I was at the top of my class for our tour group of around 30 people. I think there were two of us that admitted to loving Middle Earth that much.   Do you recognize where I am standing in the picture above?  If you said Bag End, you are correct!  The home of Bilbo and Frodo.  I swear that even though I was with a very unruly tour group I could almost convince myself I was &ldquo;really&rdquo; there at times.  Oh, yes my vivid imagination.  Only slight eye roll from Jane.</p>\n<p>We got there early thinking we might be able to get in on an earlier tour, but as we listened to the people who had not pre-booked their tour in front of us learn that the next available slot was 5:00 this afternoon or tomorrow we realized that we were going to have an opportunity to enjoy our crackers and cheese that we had been bringing with us for the last couple of days.  Crackers, cheese, meat and Ginger Beer, make a pretty good picnic.  I went into the gift shop to kill a little time and other than a bottle of Middle Earth wine, I was pretty much ready to leave immediately.  I was struck by the fact that they were selling &ldquo;The One Ring&rdquo; in multiple sizes!  (what!?) for only $190.00.   To be honest I knew this was coming because our tour guide, Robo, on the great ocean road told me he bought one.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/NZ/signpost.jpg\" alt=\"\"> Hobbiton is largely preserved as it was after it was rebuilt for the Hobbit trilogy.  Its amazing to me that for Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit there was less than 4 months of filming here.  Our tour guide told us several stories about how much Peter Jackson was obsessed with staying true to the book and keeping things logical.  For example we passed by some apple trees in a small grove, in the books this grove was described as plum trees.  So, Jackson made someone take all the apples and leaves off the tree and put on fake leaves and fake plums for a shot that got less than 5 seconds of screen time.  You can only imagine the outcry of true fans who would remember that they were supposed to be plum trees but saw apples on the trees in that little segment instead!</p>\n<p>Another example; in the picture of me at Bag End, the tree above me is actually fake!  It was a beautiful old oak tree in the Lord of the Rings, but since the Hobbit was supposed to be 65 years earlier than LotR Jackson made the crew chop it down and replace it with a fake younger tree!  Even worse, the company in charge of making the fake leaves did a bad job on the leaves and they had faded by the time filming was supposed to start.  So, Jackson ordered someone to repaint all 200,000 leaves on the fake tree!</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/NZ/hobbit_barrow.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We also learned a bit about film tricks for making people look bigger and smaller.  Some of the hobbit holes were made quite small so that when an adult human stood beside the door they looked very large.  Others were built at full size so that the door would look fine when a hobbit was standing next to it.  In other cases parts of the set were created special to create a perspective effect.  For example the wagon that Gandalf and Frodo are riding in the wagon together the wagon was constructed to be 3 meters long.  Gandalf rode in the front so that he looked very big while Frodo sat in the very back so that when filmed he looked very small, and like he was sitting next to Gandalf.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/NZ/green_dragon.jpg\" alt=\"Green Dragon\"></p>\n<p>At the end of the tour we stopped at the Green Dragon for Ale!  I don&rsquo;t think this was where the scenes were filmed as every other structure here was created for filming from the outside in, or with just enough room for the camera crew to film from the inside out.  All indoor scenes were filmed in the studio, but this is part of the process of making Hobbiton more interesting for visitors.  We had a couple of choices of Ale, a cider, or a Ginger Beer.  This was also a great place to get some pictures of the Green Dragon along with the Mill and the pond.</p>\n<p>The tour really makes you appreciate camera angles!  On the bus back to the gift shop we saw some video clips from the movie and its amazing how large everything looks compared to how it seems in person.  I can&rsquo;t wait to get home and watch the extended edition disks that Josh bought me for Christmas.  Maybe with a few days off we will find time to watch them together.</p>\n<p>Today was also our last day in New Zealand and marks the beginning of the journey home.  Tomorrow morning we fly to Fiji!  The Novotel airport is just 25 yards from the entrance to the international terminal, so one good thing is that we don&rsquo;t even need a cab to get to the airport in plenty of time for our flight!   I&rsquo;m looking forward to a couple days of R&amp;R on the water!</p>\n",

Crackers, cheese, meat and Ginger Beer, make a pretty good picnic.  I went into the gift shop to kill a little time and other than a bottle of Middle Earth wine, I was pretty much ready to leave immediately.  I was struck by the fact that they were selling \"The One Ring\" in multiple sizes!  (what!?) for only $190.00.   To be honest I knew this was coming because our tour guide, Robo, on the great ocean road told me he bought one.\n\n\n\n![](../images/NZ/signpost.jpg) Hobbiton is largely preserved as it was after it was rebuilt for the Hobbit trilogy.  Its amazing to me that for Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit there was less than 4 months of filming here.  Our tour guide told us several stories about how much Peter Jackson was obsessed with staying true to the book and keeping things logical.  For example we passed by some apple trees in a small grove, in the books this grove was described as plum trees.  So, Jackson made someone take all the apples and leaves off the tree and put on fake leaves and fake plums for a shot that got less than 5 seconds of screen time.  You can only imagine the outcry of true fans who would remember that they were supposed to be plum trees but saw apples on the trees in that little segment instead!  \n\n\n\nAnother example; in the picture of me at Bag End, the tree above me is actually fake!  It was a beautiful old oak tree in the Lord of the Rings, but since the Hobbit was supposed to be 65 years earlier than LotR Jackson made the crew chop it down and replace it with a fake younger tree!  Even worse, the company in charge of making the fake leaves did a bad job on the leaves and they had faded by the time filming was supposed to start.  So, Jackson ordered someone to repaint all 200,000 leaves on the fake tree!\n\n\n\n![](../images/NZ/hobbit_barrow.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe also learned a bit about film tricks for making people look bigger and smaller.  Some of the hobbit holes were made quite small so that when an adult human stood beside the door they looked very large.  Others were built at full size so that the door would look fine when a hobbit was standing next to it.  In other cases parts of the set were created special to create a perspective effect.  For example the wagon that Gandalf and Frodo are riding in the wagon together the wagon was constructed to be 3 meters long.  Gandalf rode in the front so that he looked very big while Frodo sat in the very back so that when filmed he looked very small, and like he was sitting next to Gandalf.\n\n\n\n![Green Dragon](../images/NZ/green_dragon.jpg)\n\n\n\nAt the end of the tour we stopped at the Green Dragon for Ale!  I don't think this was where the scenes were filmed as every other structure here was created for filming from the outside in, or with just enough room for the camera crew to film from the inside out.  All indoor scenes were filmed in the studio, but this is part of the process of making Hobbiton more interesting for visitors.  We had a couple of choices of Ale, a cider, or a Ginger Beer.  This was also a great place to get some pictures of the Green Dragon along with the Mill and the pond.\n\n\n\n The tour really makes you appreciate camera angles!  On the bus back to the gift shop we saw some video clips from the movie and its amazing how large everything looks compared to how it seems in person.  I can't wait to get home and watch the extended edition disks that Josh bought me for Christmas.  Maybe with a few days off we will find time to watch them together.\n\n \n\n Today was also our last day in New Zealand and marks the beginning of the journey home.  Tomorrow morning we fly to Fiji!  The Novotel airport is just 25 yards from the entrance to the international terminal, so one good thing is that we don't even need a cab to get to the airport in plenty of time for our flight!   I'm looking forward to a couple days of R&R on the water!\n\n \n",

I&rsquo;m going to have to talk to someone at Fareway about stocking Ginger Beer! After lunch we made our way North for another hour to Rotorua.

We decided to go for the adult option because that gave us a choice of 8 different pools and there was no time limit.  We would have to wait for the private pool and then we were limited to 30 minutes.  Anyway, communal bathing is certainly illustrative of many interesting cultural differences.

				"title": "Driving the West Coast",
				"content_html": "<p>After two weeks of organized tours and bus rides we struck out on our own today in a rental car.  New Zealand drives on the left and there are many helpful arrows painted on the road to remind the foreign drivers of that fact.  As always, Jane took the drivers seat and I rode shotgun in on the passenger side.  We left Queenstown after a nice breakfast at the hotel and headed toward the west coast.  Our destination for the first night was Franz Josef.  A small little town near the Franz Josef glacier.</p>\n<p>A couple of observations about driving in New Zealand</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>One lane bridges are everywhere!  We counted twenty seven one lane bridges on our 280km journey the first day.  I think this is part of the great environmental movement in New Zealand that they think really carefully before messing with anything in nature.  Sure it slows you down a bit and occasionally you need to wait for a couple of cars to cross before you can take your turn but maybe a reminder to slow down is a good thing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>They have these nice bullseye signs that say 100 its not a target, drive according to conditions.  its pretty hard to drive 100km/hr anyway as the roads are very twisty.  I would guess we averaged closer to 60km/hr.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Cell phone coverage outside the cities is pretty much non-existent.

				"content_text": "After two weeks of organized tours and bus rides we struck out on our own today in a rental car.  New Zealand drives on the left and there are many helpful arrows painted on the road to remind the foreign drivers of that fact.  As always, Jane took the drivers seat and I rode shotgun in on the passenger side.  We left Queenstown after a nice breakfast at the hotel and headed toward the west coast.  Our destination for the first night was Franz Josef.  A small little town near the Franz Josef glacier. \n\n\n\nA couple of observations about driving in New Zealand\n\n\n\n* One lane bridges are everywhere!  We counted twenty seven one lane bridges on our 280km journey the first day.  I think this is part of the great environmental movement in New Zealand that they think really carefully before messing with anything in nature.  Sure it slows you down a bit and occasionally you need to wait for a couple of cars to cross before you can take your turn but maybe a reminder to slow down is a good thing.\n\n* They have these nice bullseye signs that say 100 its not a target, drive according to conditions.  its pretty hard to drive 100km/hr anyway as the roads are very twisty.  I would guess we averaged closer to 60km/hr. \n\n* Cell phone coverage outside the cities is pretty much non-existent.  I'm pretty sure this is again related to the environmental focus of the country.  Don't mess up the countryside by installing thousands of cell towers.

We had sort of concluded that if the helicopter return was not going to go, and we could back out at this late time, we would cancel and just enjoy a day of leisure in Queenstown.  The Helicopter was not confirmed, we were the only two booked, and they need at least four people booked to fly.

We would just have to wait to know for sure.  But again, Barry the bus driver was optimistic.</p>\n<p>The two hour boat tour of Milford Sound was really great.  The boat moved along slowly just a few meters from the sheer mountainside.  The walls of the mountain come straight out of the water and soar 5-6 thousand meters over us.

At least one other couple had upgraded to confirm our helicopter tour back to Queenstown!  Now we just had to get out of Milford before the custard formed.</p>\n<p>We rode the shuttle to the airport with another couple from our bus and hopped off just in time to see one helicopter take off and another, the color we were looking for, come in for a landing.  However&hellip; as the pilot got out of our copter and started toward us, a bus pulled up and dropped off another couple.  the pilot looked at all of our tickets and got a very perplexed look on his face.  the two people he had brought in were booked to go right back, and now there were a total of eight of us for a six passenger ride.  After some time, and a lot of anxious looking at the clouds turning to custard it was finally determined that the previous pilot had left prematurely.

				"title": "Three Days on the Routeburn Track",
				"content_html": "<h2 id=\"day-zero\">Day Zero</h2>\n<p><img src=\"../images/NZ/green_falls.jpg\" alt=\"New Zealand Falls\"></p>\n<p>We arrived in Queenstown just in time to appreciate the change in temperature. We left the 90 degree weather in Melbourne and arrived to 70 degree weather in Queenstown.  It was a very welcome change in both temperature and scenery.  It takes about 30 seconds to realize why Peter Jackson decided to film Lord of the Rings here!  The steep Mountains and misty low clouds around Lake Wakatipu  make you want to break out into some  dwarf songs.</p>\n<p>We had just enough time to check into the St. Moritz before a short walk down the hill to the Ultimate Hikes center for our pre-hike briefing.  Now is a good time to note that Jane and I have. noticed that we are no longer the young couple on the tours we have chosen.  Most of the people we have met and toured with so far on this trip have been 20 years younger than us.  Life Happens!  As we contemplated 3 days of hiking with 30 year olds we were getting a bit nervous.  So, we were pretty relieved to see that the vast majority of the 27 people at our briefing were in our age bracket.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is no bad weather, only bad gear!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If I didn&rsquo;t take anything else away from the briefing it was this quote.  And we were really glad that we had done our homework and invested in some good rain gear and merino wool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"day-one\">Day One</h2>\n<p>The first day of the trek kicked by meeting our guides &ndash; Jono, Anthony, Sadao, and Jo &ndash; then a bus ride leaving Queenstown at 6:30AM.  We had a two hour bus ride until our stop morning tea in Te Anau.  Every tour in Australia and New Zealand includes a stop for morning tea and scones.  Very civilized.  We had a couple more hours on the bus after morning tea before we got to the start of the trek in the Fiordland National Park.  This first day we had around four hours of trekking (7.5 miles) to get to our first night&rsquo;s lodging at Lake Mackenzie. The first hour and a half was all up hill pretty steadily, so even though we were geared up for the 50 degree weather and rain we began shedding layers only a few minutes into the hike.  With four guides, one was at the front, one at the back and two floated between people in the middle.  It didn&rsquo;t take long for us to stretch out with the back being about an hour behind the front.  We were somewhere near the middle.</p>\n<p>We carried our lunches in with us, and we carried the rubbish out.  The National Parks in New Zealand have no rubbish bins to prevent animals from learning to scavenge food.  It works well.  I don&rsquo;t think we saw one bit of litter anywhere along the track.  We hiked uphill to Howden Hut where we had our lunch stop along with hot tea and coffee made by our guides.  We walked out of the rain shortly after lunch and enjoyed a really scenic hike through the afternoon.  The highlight of the afternoon was definitely the Earland Falls.  Anthony said, make sure you have your inhalers, it will take your breath away.  And he was right.  As with many of the sites on our trip pictures don&rsquo;t do justice to the actual scene.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/NZ/earland_falls.jpg\" alt=\"Earland Falls\"></p>\n<p>We arrived MacKenzie hut around 4:00 and we were definitely ready to stop for the day.  We were met at the entrance by Chris who had hot chocolate (called Milo here down under) and snacks for us.  He gave us a quick tour of the lodge and showed us to our room.   We were  blown away by the accomodations.  Ultimate Hikes made some kind deal with the Department of Conservation (DOC) whereby they built new facilities for the park in exchange for getting the concession for guided hikes and the ability to build their own huts on the track.  They were so clean and nice.  We had our own room with ensuite and shower.  There was a clothes washing area, and a huge warm room called the drying room.  Then a really nice common area where we could hang out, have a drink, eat our meals and get to know the rest of our group.</p>\n<p>For dinner tonight we had entrees of Hummus or Salmon spread with cheese and meat.  For our main we had  our choice between a New Zealand Rib Eye and Chicken.  For desert we had brownies and ice cream.   Yes we were &ldquo;roughing it&rdquo; all right.  It took us a few meals to understand that in Australia and New Zealand they call appetizers &ldquo;entrees&rdquo; and the entree is called the &ldquo;main.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/NZ/mackenzie_lodge.jpg\" alt=\"mackenzie_lodge\"></p>\n<p>Unfortunately the first night we also got to watch a helicopter landing.  One of our group had fallen on the track and broken her wrist and hurt her leg pretty badly. So, she and her husband were evacuated by helicopter.  The rescue team landed on a tiny little pad right next to the hut.  Clearly these guys know what they are doing to drop out of the clouds and land right on target.</p>\n<p>At 10:00 the generators are shut off until 7:30 the next morning.  But that really wasn&rsquo;t a problem as we were all in bed by 9:30 that first night!  I was talking to one of the guides about their arrangement with the DOC and he said that the generator times, along with every detail down to the dishwashing soap and toilet paper was negotiated to have minimal environmental impact on the National Park.   Everything at the hut is flown in and out by helicopter once a week.</p>\n<h2 id=\"day-two\">Day Two</h2>\n<p><img src=\"../images/NZ/lake_mackenzie.jpg\" alt=\"Mackenzie Lake\"></p>\n<p>Day two began with sandwich making at 7:45.  Amazingly we slept solid until 7:00 when I needed to get up and use the ensuite.   A few experimental steps revealed that all the limbs were still working as they should with amazingly little stiffness.  Continental breakfast was at 8:15 followed by eggs Benedict at 8:30.  At 9:15 we met for a group photo by Lake Mackenzie and then we were off for a good six hours of walking.   The beginning was again steadily up hill, then we rounded the mountain onto the rainy and windy side! The distance for today was just 6.9 miles but it was slower going than yesterday! There is no bad weather, only bad gear I repeated to myself.  Nevertheless we made it to the hut on Harris Saddle for our rest/lunch stop.  After lunch I did the optional climb up Conical Hill while Jane continued on towards the Routeburn Lodge with a few others.  After the Harris Saddle and the Conical Hill the rest of the day was down hill  which was nice but pretty hard on my calfs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../images/NZ/harris_lake.jpg\" alt=\"Conical Hill\"></p>\n<p>A couple times today we were rewarded with a glimpse of what a great view we could have on one of the rare clear days.  Still it was all beautiful in a Lord of the Rings kind of way.  Although I walked by myself most of the afternoon, I enjoyed just going my own pace and enjoying the views.</p>\n<p>The second night we stayed at Routeburn lodge.  By the way if you&rsquo;ve been reading Routeburn as &ldquo;rowt burn&rdquo; you are doing it wrong, it is &ldquo;root burn.&rdquo; This lodge is very similar to the Lake Mackenzie lodge but with a great view of the valley and the Routeburn falls right behind.  We were all bit more tired and a lot more wet than we were the day before.  So dinner was served a bit earlier.  Tonights fare included a delicious Pesto soup as the entree followed by a choice of Salmon or New Zealand lamb chops.  By now we had gotten to know a lot of our fellow trekkers pretty well, so before dinner and during dinner conversation was very lively.  We have met a surprising number of people from Chicago on this trip and we have really enjoyed getting to know them, especially Dave and Lynn Reiner.  We also met lots of nice people from New Zealand including a couple women (Jennifer and Megan) who reminded me of Jane and Shirley if they had New Zealand accents and were to take off on their own adventure.  Lots of the people in the group were involved in education including the two women I mentioned and  Professor Tiano from Duke University in Singapore.</p>\n<p>It was nice to be surrounded by other academics as I was beginning to stress about the impending NSF grant deadline back home.  Leaving my co-authors to finish the proposal while I was totally off the grid for 3 days is not the best plan. Of course agreeing to do the grant in the first place when you know the deadline is in the middle of your holiday does not show the best judgement either.</p>\n<h2 id=\"day-three\">Day Three</h2>\n<p>I woke up at about 4AM on day three, once again needing to use the ensuite.  However my first couple of steps out of bed were so painful I spent the next couple hours in and out of sleep wondering if my muscles would loosen enough for me to walk down the track on my own power.  Thankfully day three dawned bright and sunny for the final 5.7 miles of our trek.  Once again we started our day with sandwich making followed by continental breakfast and then eggs and bacon.  Sadly it took me until day three to get lesson in making a proper cup of Milo from Jono.

				"content_text": "## Day Zero\n\n\n\n![New Zealand Falls](../images/NZ/green_falls.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe arrived in Queenstown just in time to appreciate the change in temperature. We left the 90 degree weather in Melbourne and arrived to 70 degree weather in Queenstown.  It was a very welcome change in both temperature and scenery.  It takes about 30 seconds to realize why Peter Jackson decided to film Lord of the Rings here!  The steep Mountains and misty low clouds around Lake Wakatipu  make you want to break out into some  dwarf songs.\n\n\n\nWe had just enough time to check into the St. Moritz before a short walk down the hill to the Ultimate Hikes center for our pre-hike briefing.  Now is a good time to note that Jane and I have. noticed that we are no longer the young couple on the tours we have chosen.  Most of the people we have met and toured with so far on this trip have been 20 years younger than us.  Life Happens!  As we contemplated 3 days of hiking with 30 year olds we were getting a bit nervous.  So, we were pretty relieved to see that the vast majority of the 27 people at our briefing were in our age bracket.\n\n\n\n> There is no bad weather, only bad gear!\n\n\n\nIf I didn't take anything else away from the briefing it was this quote.  And we were really glad that we had done our homework and invested in some good rain gear and merino wool.\n\n\n\n## Day One\n\n\n\nThe first day of the trek kicked by meeting our guides -- Jono, Anthony, Sadao, and Jo -- then a bus ride leaving Queenstown at 6:30AM.  We had a two hour bus ride until our stop morning tea in Te Anau.  Every tour in Australia and New Zealand includes a stop for morning tea and scones.  Very civilized.  We had a couple more hours on the bus after morning tea before we got to the start of the trek in the Fiordland National Park.  This first day we had around four hours of trekking (7.5 miles) to get to our first night's lodging at Lake Mackenzie. The first hour and a half was all up hill pretty steadily, so even though we were geared up for the 50 degree weather and rain we began shedding layers only a few minutes into the hike.  With four guides, one was at the front, one at the back and two floated between people in the middle.  It didn't take long for us to stretch out with the back being about an hour behind the front.  We were somewhere near the middle.  \n\n\n\nWe carried our lunches in with us, and we carried the rubbish out.  The National Parks in New Zealand have no rubbish bins to prevent animals from learning to scavenge food.  It works well.  I don't think we saw one bit of litter anywhere along the track.  We hiked uphill to Howden Hut where we had our lunch stop along with hot tea and coffee made by our guides.  We walked out of the rain shortly after lunch and enjoyed a really scenic hike through the afternoon.  The highlight of the afternoon was definitely the Earland Falls.  Anthony said, make sure you have your inhalers, it will take your breath away.  And he was right.  As with many of the sites on our trip pictures don't do justice to the actual scene.\n\n\n\n![Earland Falls](../images/NZ/earland_falls.jpg)\n\n\n\nWe arrived MacKenzie hut around 4:00 and we were definitely ready to stop for the day.  We were met at the entrance by Chris who had hot chocolate (called Milo here down under) and snacks for us.  He gave us a quick tour of the lodge and showed us to our room.   We were  blown away by the accomodations.  Ultimate Hikes made some kind deal with the Department of Conservation (DOC) whereby they built new facilities for the park in exchange for getting the concession for guided hikes and the ability to build their own huts on the track.  They were so clean and nice.  We had our own room with ensuite and shower.  There was a clothes washing area, and a huge warm room called the drying room.  Then a really nice common area where we could hang out, have a drink, eat our meals and get to know the rest of our group.  \n\n\n\nFor dinner tonight we had entrees of Hummus or Salmon spread with cheese and meat.  For our main we had  our choice between a New Zealand Rib Eye and Chicken.  For desert we had brownies and ice cream.   Yes we were \"roughing it\" all right.  It took us a few meals to understand that in Australia and New Zealand they call appetizers \"entrees\" and the entree is called the \"main.\"\n\n\n\n![mackenzie_lodge](../images/NZ/mackenzie_lodge.jpg)\n\n\n\nUnfortunately the first night we also got to watch a helicopter landing.  One of our group had fallen on the track and broken her wrist and hurt her leg pretty badly. So, she and her husband were evacuated by helicopter.  The rescue team landed on a tiny little pad right next to the hut.  Clearly these guys know what they are doing to drop out of the clouds and land right on target.\n\n\n\nAt 10:00 the generators are shut off until 7:30 the next morning.  But that really wasn't a problem as we were all in bed by 9:30 that first night!  I was talking to one of the guides about their arrangement with the DOC and he said that the generator times, along with every detail down to the dishwashing soap and toilet paper was negotiated to have minimal environmental impact on the National Park.   Everything at the hut is flown in and out by helicopter once a week.\n\n\n\n## Day Two\n\n\n\n![Mackenzie Lake](../images/NZ/lake_mackenzie.jpg)\n\n\n\nDay two began with sandwich making at 7:45.  Amazingly we slept solid until 7:00 when I needed to get up and use the ensuite.   A few experimental steps revealed that all the limbs were still working as they should with amazingly little stiffness.  Continental breakfast was at 8:15 followed by eggs Benedict at 8:30.  At 9:15 we met for a group photo by Lake Mackenzie and then we were off for a good six hours of walking.   The beginning was again steadily up hill, then we rounded the mountain onto the rainy and windy side! The distance for today was just 6.9 miles but it was slower going than yesterday! There is no bad weather, only bad gear I repeated to myself.  Nevertheless we made it to the hut on Harris Saddle for our rest/lunch stop.  After lunch I did the optional climb up Conical Hill while Jane continued on towards the Routeburn Lodge with a few others.  After the Harris Saddle and the Conical Hill the rest of the day was down hill  which was nice but pretty hard on my calfs.  \n\n\n\n![Conical Hill](../images/NZ/harris_lake.jpg)\n\n\n\nA couple times today we were rewarded with a glimpse of what a great view we could have on one of the rare clear days.  Still it was all beautiful in a Lord of the Rings kind of way.  Although I walked by myself most of the afternoon, I enjoyed just going my own pace and enjoying the views.\n\n\n\nThe second night we stayed at Routeburn lodge.  By the way if you've been reading Routeburn as \"rowt burn\" you are doing it wrong, it is \"root burn.\" This lodge is very similar to the Lake Mackenzie lodge but with a great view of the valley and the Routeburn falls right behind.  We were all bit more tired and a lot more wet than we were the day before.  So dinner was served a bit earlier.  Tonights fare included a delicious Pesto soup as the entree followed by a choice of Salmon or New Zealand lamb chops.  By now we had gotten to know a lot of our fellow trekkers pretty well, so before dinner and during dinner conversation was very lively.  We have met a surprising number of people from Chicago on this trip and we have really enjoyed getting to know them, especially Dave and Lynn Reiner.  We also met lots of nice people from New Zealand including a couple women (Jennifer and Megan) who reminded me of Jane and Shirley if they had New Zealand accents and were to take off on their own adventure.  Lots of the people in the group were involved in education including the two women I mentioned and  Professor Tiano from Duke University in Singapore.  \n\n\n\nIt was nice to be surrounded by other academics as I was beginning to stress about the impending NSF grant deadline back home.  Leaving my co-authors to finish the proposal while I was totally off the grid for 3 days is not the best plan. Of course agreeing to do the grant in the first place when you know the deadline is in the middle of your holiday does not show the best judgement either.\n\n\n\n## Day Three\n\n\n\nI woke up at about 4AM on day three, once again needing to use the ensuite.  However my first couple of steps out of bed were so painful I spent the next couple hours in and out of sleep wondering if my muscles would loosen enough for me to walk down the track on my own power.  Thankfully day three dawned bright and sunny for the final 5.7 miles of our trek.  Once again we started our day with sandwich making followed by continental breakfast and then eggs and bacon.  Sadly it took me until day three to get lesson in making a proper cup of Milo from Jono.  To anyone who may happen upon this in preparation for a trip to New Zealand here is the procedure:  pour a couple tablespoons of cream into your coffee cup, then add six, yes six, spoonfuls of milo and mix it into a paste with the cream.  You may have to add more to get the right pasty consistency.  Then after you have a good chocolatey paste you can add the hot water.\n\n\n\n![Routeburn Flats](../images/NZ/routeburn_flats.jpg)\n\n\n\nToday's walk was the easiest of the three with the route being mostly down hill to the Routeburn flats and then more gentle downhill  for the 5.7 mile distance to the end of the route.

People will say that is quite an accomplishment these days, I just can&rsquo;t believe that 30 years have gone by so quickly.  We have two amazing children that have grown into wonderful young adults.  Yes, one of them is older than we were when we got married.  We have had 30 years of incredible adventures, we have seen a pretty good fraction of the world, and are looking forward to seeing lots more of it.  I&rsquo;ve had a pretty great career doing what I love.  I couldn&rsquo;t have done any of it without Jane.  Thanks honey!</p>\n<p>We started today at Moraine Lake, its smaller than Lake Louise, and when you walk up to the waters edge you might think, meh, not as blue as Louise either.  But if you climb up the rocks near the waters edge you don&rsquo;t have to go very far before you realize its just a matter of perspective.  Of course climbing the rocks was part of the fun, but once we got to the top we realized there was a much easier way to get there!

People will say that is quite an accomplishment these days, I just can't believe that 30 years have gone by so quickly.  We have two amazing children that have grown into wonderful young adults.  Yes, one of them is older than we were when we got married.  We have had 30 years of incredible adventures, we have seen a pretty good fraction of the world, and are looking forward to seeing lots more of it.  I've had a pretty great career doing what I love.  I couldn't have done any of it without Jane.  Thanks honey!\n\n\n\nWe started today at Moraine Lake, its smaller than Lake Louise, and when you walk up to the waters edge you might think, meh, not as blue as Louise either.  But if you climb up the rocks near the waters edge you don't have to go very far before you realize its just a matter of perspective.

We pulled off Highway 1 expecting an easy (and cheap) experience only to find the lines 6 cars deep.  Thankfully there was a nice guy directing traffic who got us over to the line for the end pump.  It could have been a real disaster trying to make the turn out of the station if we didn&rsquo;t have the extra room.

				"content_html": "<p>The Bucket Dive</p>\n<p>According to our dive logs it&rsquo;s been 13 years since we did our last dive.  So, when we decided to make a last minute trip to the Caribbean for Spring Break this year we decided that one of our activities should be a refresher dive to get current.  This turned out to be a great decision.  We thought that doing the refresher early in the cruise would be good, since it would allow us the flexibility of doing a second dive later on.  The bonus was that the Bucket Regatta was happening in St. Bart&rsquo;s so the dive turned into a dive plus several hours in a Zodiac &ldquo;chasing the race&rdquo;   Wow!!</p>\n<p>We arrived at the pier at 9:30 and we were greeted by a French woman, Isabelle.  She was busy unpacking tanks and BV&rsquo;s etc, but was very friendly.  We asked if we needed to do any paperwork, assuming the standard waivers etc.  &ldquo;No, we are French&rdquo; she said as if that was all the explanation we needed.  We were joined by a dozen other French speaking people, all much younger than us. When did this happen?  We used to be the younger ones on these adventures!  It was totally unclear which of them were assistants, and which of them were other guests like us.  After getting everyone organized, Emmanuel, the Captain, told us that we would be diving with Elizabeth.  &ldquo;Who is Elizabeth?&rdquo;  I asked.  &ldquo;She is the blonde Woman, my wife.   my wife&rdquo; he said with a grin.   The refresher turned out to be just the perfect amount of review.  It&rsquo;s just like riding a bike Isabelle told us. She was right.  After a few minutes we were enjoying the freedom of exploring the reef.</p>\n<p>Under water we saw, a couple of Barracuda, a sea turtle napping in a little alcove, a bunch of HUGE lobster, and a couple of grouchy eels.  We also saw the usual assortment of Tangs and Wrasse, Parrotfish and Lionfish.  After a slow start, my ears started to clear a bit easier and I made it down 60 feet.  A very good dive.  A day later, as I write this I&rsquo;m still waiting for my inner ears to clear, which is a problem I had 13 years ago.

First, the beauty of these huge boats is just amazing.  With the sun gleaming off the huge white sails they were really spectacular.  It was shocking to watch them fly past us completely silently, listing 30 degrees or more with their sails full of wind.

				"title": "No Easy Solutions",
				"content_html": "<h1 id=\"no-easy-solutions\">No Easy Solutions</h1>\n<p>If you were king how would you end poverty? Not an easy question to\nanswer, even if you were king <strong>with a magic wand</strong> its not an easy\nproblem to solve. Neverthless it was a question that one of our intrepid\nstudents put to a Stanford professor one day. This became a common\nquestion that we asked almost everyone we met with, and it was a\nquestion that generated a lot of good group conversation. I would like\nto summarize a few of the answers we heard and add my own half-baked\nidea at the end.</p>\n<p>Two weeks ago we visited Dr. David Grusky at the Stanford Center for\nPoverty and inequality. I took away a couple of key points from this\nmeeting. One of their key tasks is to get better and more frequent data\nabout poverty in the United States. Larry told us that the data we have\ntoday is collected too infrequently and by the time the data is\npublished it is nine months out of date! Wow, thats crazy. The software\ndevelopment manager in me says, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t fix what you can&rsquo;t\nmeasure&rdquo; If we are not measuring poverty how can we hope to make\nprogress toward fixing it. Hint: We can&rsquo;t.</p>\n<p>In terms of a big solution Dr. Grusky expressed his idea quite\neloquently. &ldquo;We have to make everyone live together.&rdquo; At first I\nrejected the idea as overly simple and impractical. But the more I\nthought about it the more I liked it. Making people of all income levels\nlive next to each other would surely build community, where we would not\nsee each other as &ldquo;other&rdquo; but rather as friends and neighbors. Who\ndoesn&rsquo;t want to help their neighbors? Who is my neighbor is a question\nthat has been nagging us since the disciples first asked the question of\nJesus a couple thousand years ago. The more we live in community the\nmore we see each other as people.</p>\n<p>To return to the theme of Decorah in the previous post, I think this\nreally is one of the strengths of a small town. Rich people, middle\nincome people, and poor people all live together. Maybe not next door,\nbut definitely on the same block. Our kids go to the same schools and\nparticipate on the same teams and choirs and bands together. We meet\nparents over the common ground of our kids and their achievements. Over\nthe years one of the most amazing aspects of the Decorah schools to me\nis that there is such a high level of mutual respect among students no\nmatter what they do. The &ldquo;jocks&rdquo; are also in the choir, and if not\nthey scertainly support the choir, and vice versa. Its this kind of\nintegration that leads to great things. If you don&rsquo;t believe me I&rsquo;ll\ntell you that Decorah has won the Iowa Challenge cup so many times in\nthe last ten years that people at the state just call it the &ldquo;Decorah\nprize.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why is this so important? The more integrated we become, and the more\nwe see each other as friends and peers the more we will help each\nother solve our problems. The more integrated we live the more our\nkids go to the same schools.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In broad terms the next set of solutions revolve around <strong>economic\nmobility</strong>, that is how do we get people to move up the economic ladder?</p>\n<p>One answer to this question that came up several times was around\neducation. Even our own president Carlson took a shot at this question\nat an alumni event we attended. Education leads to opportunity and or\nthe ability to move up the economic ladder. <a href=\"https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/privilege-and-inequality-in-silicon-valley-92d455b66860\">Here&rsquo;s a great story that\nillustrates</a>\nOf course not everyone gets to go to Stanford and tap into the amazing\ngroup of VC&rsquo;s and successful entrepreneurs that are part of the\nStanford alumni network. But education opens many doors to higher paying\njobs no matter where it comes from. The theme of education was also\nevident at the <a href=\"http://www.creativecommons.org\">Creative Commons</a> where\nwe discussed open source licensing models and how organizations like\nOpen MIT and others are making high quality courseware available on the\nweb. This of course is not unlike what we are doing at\n<a href=\"http://runestoneinteractive.org\">Runestone</a>.</p>\n<p>Another really interesting discussion about economic mobility comes from\n<a href=\"http://kiva.org\">Kiva</a> . While Kiva has been making loans abroad for a\nfew years, Kiva has started to make micro loans (up to $10,000) right\nhere in the United States. The Kiva story goes something like this. A\nmicro loan is not going to vault you up the economic ladder, it may not\neven get you onto the first rung. But it <strong>will</strong> give you a foothold on\nthe ladder where you might just be able to reach the first rung with a\nlittle time and experience. Without the microlending infrastructure in\nplace, we wondered how Kiva decides who to loan to. The answer is\nsimple, &ldquo;If you can show us that you have convinced 25 people to loan\nyou 25 dollars then we will put you on the site.&rdquo; Between Kiva and the\nMiller Center for Social Entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University we\nhave enough examples of these small scale loans in action to make it\nvery believable that it is a path up the economic ladder.</p>\n",

Larry told us that the data we have\ntoday is collected too infrequently and by the time the data is\npublished it is nine months out of date! Wow, thats crazy. The software\ndevelopment manager in me says, \"you can't fix what you can't\nmeasure\" If we are not measuring poverty how can we hope to make\nprogress toward fixing it. Hint: We can't.\n\nIn terms of a big solution Dr. Grusky expressed his idea quite\neloquently. \"We have to make everyone live together.\" At first I\nrejected the idea as overly simple and impractical. But the more I\nthought about it the more I liked it. Making people of all income levels\nlive next to each other would surely build community, where we would not\nsee each other as \"other\" but rather as friends and neighbors. Who\ndoesn't want to help their neighbors? Who is my neighbor is a question\nthat has been nagging us since the disciples first asked the question of\nJesus a couple thousand years ago. The more we live in community the\nmore we see each other as people.\n\nTo return to the theme of Decorah in the previous post, I think this\nreally is one of the strengths of a small town. Rich people, middle\nincome people, and poor people all live together. Maybe not next door,\nbut definitely on the same block. Our kids go to the same schools and\nparticipate on the same teams and choirs and bands together. We meet\nparents over the common ground of our kids and their achievements. Over\nthe years one of the most amazing aspects of the Decorah schools to me\nis that there is such a high level of mutual respect among students no\nmatter what they do. The \"jocks\" are also in the choir, and if not\nthey scertainly support the choir, and vice versa. Its this kind of\nintegration that leads to great things. If you don't believe me I'll\ntell you that Decorah has won the Iowa Challenge cup so many times in\nthe last ten years that people at the state just call it the \"Decorah\nprize.\"\n\n> Why is this so important? The more integrated we become, and the more\n> we see each other as friends and peers the more we will help each\n> other solve our problems. The more integrated we live the more our\n> kids go to the same schools.\n\nIn broad terms the next set of solutions revolve around **economic\nmobility**, that is how do we get people to move up the economic ladder?\n\nOne answer to this question that came up several times was around\neducation. Even our own president Carlson took a shot at this question\nat an alumni event we attended. Education leads to opportunity and or\nthe ability to move up the economic ladder. [Here's a great story that\nillustrates](https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/privilege-and-inequality-in-silicon-valley-92d455b66860)\nOf course not everyone gets to go to Stanford and tap into the amazing\ngroup of VC's and successful entrepreneurs that are part of the\nStanford alumni network. But education opens many doors to higher paying\njobs no matter where it comes from. The theme of education was also\nevident at the [Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org) where\nwe discussed open source licensing models and how organizations like\nOpen MIT and others are making high quality courseware available on the\nweb. This of course is not unlike what we are doing at\n[Runestone](http://runestoneinteractive.org).\n\nAnother really interesting discussion about economic mobility comes from\n[Kiva](http://kiva.org) . While Kiva has been making loans abroad for a\nfew years, Kiva has started to make micro loans (up to \\$10,000) right\nhere in the United States. The Kiva story goes something like this. A\nmicro loan is not going to vault you up the economic ladder, it may not\neven get you onto the first rung. But it **will** give you a foothold on\nthe ladder where you might just be able to reach the first rung with a\nlittle time and experience. Without the microlending infrastructure in\nplace, we wondered how Kiva decides who to loan to. The answer is\nsimple, \"If you can show us that you have convinced 25 people to loan\nyou 25 dollars then we will put you on the site.\" Between Kiva and the\nMiller Center for Social Entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University we\nhave enough examples of these small scale loans in action to make it\nvery believable that it is a path up the economic ladder.\n",

				"content_html": "<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> These are my shoes.  I bought them for the great adventure of 2015, I started to wear them on January 1 when we left the USA.  According to the health app on my iPhone they now have 647 miles on them.  Much of that has been accumulated during our time in Malta and our travels around the Mediterranean with Angel, Ben, Emma, Erika, Ethan, Jenna, Katie, Meredith, Meredith, Olivia, Rachel, and Tricia, hereafter known as our kids, or our Malta students.  What started out as a funny offhand comment, referring to Jane and I as Mom and Dad has come to feel more true over the few months.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m starting this post on our penultimate weekend with our group, I am in Rome with Jane and Josh to take in an AS Roma football game tonight.  Some of our students are in Florence for the Nordic choir concert, and some of them are back on Malta (behaving themselves).  Its good to have a bit of physical distance to help put things in perspective.</p>\n<p>I have also been reading each student&rsquo;s final journal or blog entries, and I must be turning into an old softie (good thing I have the summer to fix that) but I find myself choking up about something that each student has written.  It is true that these past few months of living and traveling together have turned us into an odd sort of family. I&rsquo;d be happy to adopt them all if I could get that guy in Marrakesh to make good on his offer of 20 camels apiece.  I’ve spent a bit of time lately looking back over all the pictures we have taken.  I put together this <a href=\"/galleries/MaltaGroups\">gallery of our group photos.</a>  If you look at the first group photo in Malta and in Rome, and compare that to the last group photo this week, can you see the difference?  Look at the group in front of the pantheon, this group was just getting to know each other, barely acclimated to the Mediterranean time zone.  Now look at the later photos, photographic evidence that we have come together as a family.</p>\n<p>So, what have I learned about myself this semester?  What are my own conclusions? This heretofore <a href=\"/posts/01/living-standards.html\" title=\"Living Standards\">unpublished entry</a> written in Cambodia sheds a bit of light on the recurrent theme of living simply.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion number one:</strong>  I can live a more simple lifestyle and live &ldquo;in the moment&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>As I read over my early posts, and remember back to the end of January when we first arrived on Malta, I am going to admit that the following thought crossed my mind:  Leave this flat NOW, and check-in to the Meridien until it is time to fly home (business class).  I am very glad that I did not do that.  Living in the cold, damp, drafty, loud, and then warm, humid,  dusty, loud, almost-but-not-quite-a-place-I-call-home has been an important experience.  Now that the end is in sight, I am glad that I had the experience of these last four months.</p>\n<p>The elves at Amazon.com must be worried about me, as I haven&rsquo;t ordered anything from them since December!  I have lived with the same ten shirts and six pairs of pants for the same period.  Other than going out to eat the material expenditures we have made so far this year are extremely minimal.  OK, I am not totally reformed as I have a new Apple Watch waiting for me back home.  But it was a good experience for me to not consume for a while.  Hopefully this will carry over back home where the temptation of Amazon Prime second day delivery makes the accumulation of stuff all too easy.</p>\n<p>What does it mean to &ldquo;live in the moment?&rdquo;  For me it means accepting life as it happens.  It means taking the time to enjoy each moment as it comes along, rather than always thinking about what is coming next.   Because I have not had daily class responsibilities, I really have been able to live in the moment for most of the last four months.   OK, I am still a worrier; I am always thinking about the worst case scenario, and what to do if said scenario becomes reality.  I am a planner, and a goal setter, I am always thinking about next week, next month, When will my next exam be?  What do I need to do for class next week?  But this semester I haven&rsquo;t really had any of that to think about.  I did worry about some parts of our travel (Morocco, Istanbul&hellip;)  But, our evening meals were typically planned at about 15:00 when I walked to Meats and Eats to buy whatever we were going to make for dinner.</p>\n<p>My time during the day was spent walking back and forth to the University.  I have subscribed to several podcasts and am now a regular listener to them.  I&rsquo;ve never had time for podcasts before.  I don&rsquo;t know why.   I spent time in class, listening and soaking up lectures on Maltese history and current issues.  I spent time in our flat, and in my office at the IT Faculty building sending countless organizational emails and working on projects and hacking.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion number two:</strong>  Follow your passion.</p>\n<p>While this may not be a discovery of the semester, it was certainly a strong affirmation of this oft espoused philosophy.  I like to tell the students in Senior Project that: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t wake up in the morning thinking about what you want to accomplish during the day, you ought to be thinking about finding a new job.&rdquo;  Now, showers aside, I think that every day in Malta I did wake up and have a great excitement about what I wanted to accomplish during the day.  Some days it was the excitement of a field trip, other days it was waking up in Morocco or Istanbul know that a day of discovery was in store, but even on the rainy days of February I had research and thinking to do that was very exciting.</p>\n<p>In fact maybe one of the best things about our time on the island was that it gave me <strong>time to think.</strong>  I spend a lot of time doing back home, and it is hard to carve out time to really step back and rethink things.  Good things happen when you take the time to think instead of do.  I feel like all of the projects I have been working on <a href=\"http://skulpt.org\" title=\"Skulpt\">Skulpt</a>, <a href=\"http://runestoneinteractive.org\" title=\"Runestone\">Runestone Interactive</a>, and the classes I will teach next semester have reaped the benefit of taking time to think.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion number three:</strong>  Push yourself outside of your comfort zone, good things will happen.</p>\n<p>I have written a lot about pushing myself beyond my comfort zone in the last six months, but it has been very exciting to see the students do likewise.  They have all grown this semester, becoming more self confident, more self reliant, and maybe more willing to take a risk.  Whether that be jumping off a rock into the Mediterranean, or immersing themselves in other cultures.  For me it may have been simply embracing my part-time role as a student of history and current issues of Malta this semester that pushed me to a new appreciation of history and culture.  It was also surely the experience of living in a flat that is much less luxurious than back home.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion number four:</strong>  Be thankful for the people who support you.</p>\n<p>Jane and I joke that we are excited to get back home so that we have more adults to talk to.  Not that our students are not adults, but we don&rsquo;t have the same conversations with twenty two year olds as we do with our fifty year old friends.  In some ways this has been a bit of an isolating experience for the two of us.  But we have grown used to it.  The silences are OK, as we know we simply don&rsquo;t have anything else to say at the moment.</p>\n<p>But, through it all Jane has been a fantastic partner in keeping this program working smoothly.  The work she has put in on our travel plans is, extremely detailed, thorough and time consuming.  Planning a trip takes patience and hours of research.  I know I appreciate it and so do the students. It always amazes me when we arrive somewhere and she knows exactly where to go and which direction to turn, while my head is swirling in confusion.  My advice to Ethan and Ben is to follow my lead and &ldquo;marry above your station.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I would also like to take this opportunity to publicly thank Corby Preus and Jon Lund in the Center for Global Learning back at Luther for all of their support.  Corby does an amazing job of helping with paperwork, and re-answering my questions about pretty much everything she has already explained to me at least once, and sometimes twice.</p>\n<p>Here in Malta I would like to thank Dr. Emanuel Buttigieg for coordinating the History of Malta course, I know I have learned a lot this semester, and it takes a lot of coordination to organize all of the lecturers from many different departments on campus.  And finally to Rachelle Mifsud for whom there is no request too large or too small for her to help out with.  Scheduling transportation at the last minute, or helping with final exam schedules.  Thanks!</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion number five:</strong>  Focus on the good</p>\n<p>I think this is a nice one to save for last, and it is a fairly recent conclusion, and clearly one that will take some practice for me.  The last Paideia lecture we did an exercise where we had to think about Malta from the perspective of each of our five senses.  What stands out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>sight &ndash; yellow limestone buildings, dog poop on the sidewalk</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>sound &ndash; honking horns, the &ldquo;angry&rdquo; maltese language</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>smell &ndash; Pizza and the salt air</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>taste &ndash; Maltese wine, Wild Boar Pasta</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>touch &ndash; rough limestone, and cold tile</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many of us commented after class about how negative most of the things we came up with sounded.  Even though the native Maltese professor came up with his own similar list.  Familiarity breeds contempt as the saying goes?</p>\n<p>But I think the important lesson was summed up by a couple of the students in their own final blog posts in which they said.  &ldquo;I do not want to remember Malta for the dog poop on the sidewalks or the horns honking outside my bedroom window&rdquo;  Rather they , and I, will choose to remember Malta for the good stuff: The crystal clear water, the blue waters of the Blue Lagoon, St. Peter&rsquo;s Pool and Golden Bay, the majestic cliffs of Gozo as viewed from the Ocean or the cliffs of Dingli from the land.  The Neolithic temples of Hagar Qim and the mysterious Hypogeum.  The beauty of the Auzure Window.  The brightly colored Maltese boats in Spinola bay.  And, yes, the ever present yellow limestone of Sliema and Valletta. This is the way to remember Malta.</p>\n<p>Don&rsquo;t sweat the small stuff my dad used to tell me.  Let the unpleasant annoying pet peeves fade away.</p>\n<h2 id=\"not-goodbye\">Not Goodbye</h2>\n<p>Although this will be my final post from Malta, this is not the end of the blog.  In less than a week, the students will be on their way either home or to european travel for part of the summer.  Meanwhile Jane and I will be finishing up our own Mediterranean experience with a few days in Lake Como and then a Cruise from Venice down the Dalmatian Coast and through the Greek Isles, ending in Istanbul.  We planned this as a celebration of the end of our time in Malta, and I&rsquo;m sure it will be, but right now we are both facing this last part of the journey with mixed emotions.  The call of home is very strong, and I know that if we simply boarded a plane to Minneapolis we would be ecstatic.  But the comfort zone of home will have to wait another twenty days.  Its really not all that much when you consider we have been gone 159 days already, and more adventure awaits us, you can be sure I&rsquo;ll continue to write about it here.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5a9457597c.jpg\" width=200 style=\"float: right;\"> These are my shoes.  I bought them for the great adventure of 2015, I started to wear them on January 1 when we left the USA.  According to the health app on my iPhone they now have 647 miles on them.  Much of that has been accumulated during our time in Malta and our travels around the Mediterranean with Angel, Ben, Emma, Erika, Ethan, Jenna, Katie, Meredith, Meredith, Olivia, Rachel, and Tricia, hereafter known as our kids, or our Malta students.  What started out as a funny offhand comment, referring to Jane and I as Mom and Dad has come to feel more true over the few months.\n\n\n\nI'm starting this post on our penultimate weekend with our group, I am in Rome with Jane and Josh to take in an AS Roma football game tonight.  Some of our students are in Florence for the Nordic choir concert, and some of them are back on Malta (behaving themselves).  Its good to have a bit of physical distance to help put things in perspective.\n\n\n\nI have also been reading each student's final journal or blog entries, and I must be turning into an old softie (good thing I have the summer to fix that) but I find myself choking up about something that each student has written.  It is true that these past few months of living and traveling together have turned us into an odd sort of family. I'd be happy to adopt them all if I could get that guy in Marrakesh to make good on his offer of 20 camels apiece.  I’ve spent a bit of time lately looking back over all the pictures we have taken.  I put together this [gallery of our group photos.](/galleries/MaltaGroups)  If you look at the first group photo in Malta and in Rome, and compare that to the last group photo this week, can you see the difference?  Look at the group in front of the pantheon, this group was just getting to know each other, barely acclimated to the Mediterranean time zone.  Now look at the later photos, photographic evidence that we have come together as a family.\n\n\n\nSo, what have I learned about myself this semester?  What are my own conclusions? This heretofore [unpublished entry](/posts/01/living-standards.html \"Living Standards\") written in Cambodia sheds a bit of light on the recurrent theme of living simply.\n\n\n\n**Conclusion number one:**  I can live a more simple lifestyle and live \"in the moment\".\n\n\n\nAs I read over my early posts, and remember back to the end of January when we first arrived on Malta, I am going to admit that the following thought crossed my mind:  Leave this flat NOW, and check-in to the Meridien until it is time to fly home (business class).  I am very glad that I did not do that.  Living in the cold, damp, drafty, loud, and then warm, humid,  dusty, loud, almost-but-not-quite-a-place-I-call-home has been an important experience.  Now that the end is in sight, I am glad that I had the experience of these last four months.\n\n\n\nThe elves at Amazon.com must be worried about me, as I haven't ordered anything from them since December!  I have lived with the same ten shirts and six pairs of pants for the same period.  Other than going out to eat the material expenditures we have made so far this year are extremely minimal.  OK, I am not totally reformed as I have a new Apple Watch waiting for me back home.  But it was a good experience for me to not consume for a while.  Hopefully this will carry over back home where the temptation of Amazon Prime second day delivery makes the accumulation of stuff all too easy. \n\n\n\nWhat does it mean to \"live in the moment?\"  For me it means accepting life as it happens.  It means taking the time to enjoy each moment as it comes along, rather than always thinking about what is coming next.   Because I have not had daily class responsibilities, I really have been able to live in the moment for most of the last four months.   OK, I am still a worrier; I am always thinking about the worst case scenario, and what to do if said scenario becomes reality.  I am a planner, and a goal setter, I am always thinking about next week, next month, When will my next exam be?  What do I need to do for class next week?  But this semester I haven't really had any of that to think about.  I did worry about some parts of our travel (Morocco, Istanbul...)  But, our evening meals were typically planned at about 15:00 when I walked to Meats and Eats to buy whatever we were going to make for dinner.\n\n\n\nMy time during the day was spent walking back and forth to the University.  I have subscribed to several podcasts and am now a regular listener to them.  I've never had time for podcasts before.  I don't know why.   I spent time in class, listening and soaking up lectures on Maltese history and current issues.

I feel like all of the projects I have been working on [Skulpt](http://skulpt.org \"Skulpt\"), [Runestone Interactive](http://runestoneinteractive.org \"Runestone\"), and the classes I will teach next semester have reaped the benefit of taking time to think.\n\n\n\n**Conclusion number three:**  Push yourself outside of your comfort zone, good things will happen.\n\n\n\nI have written a lot about pushing myself beyond my comfort zone in the last six months, but it has been very exciting to see the students do likewise.

				"title": "cooking in malta",
				"content_html": "<p>The first thing I should say about cooking in Malta is that there are around 600 reasons not to cook within walking distance.  Some of our favorites are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Guzé — OK, I <strong>love</strong> Pappardelle with wild boar sauce.  I could eat this once a week.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pepperoncino — The Rosettes (little bowls of pappardelle and proscuitto cooked in cream sauce) are to die for.  Plus a totally small town friendly vibe that you just can’t beat.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Piccolo Padre   &ndash; Eat pizza right out over the water.  Diavola yum!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Wigi’s Kitchen — You can pick your fish or your steak right at the table.  The window seats have an awesome view of Balluta bay.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Kebabji. &ndash; The students introduced us to this one.  I think of it as &ldquo;the chipotle of Sliema.&rdquo;  My favorite is Chicken-shish with Tabbouleh, Hummus, Couscous, Harissa, and Sesame sauce.   Actually its the only thing on the menu I&rsquo;ve ever ordered, but why mess up a good thing.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’m going to divide the rest of this post into three parts, that roughly describe the three stages of cooking I have gone through here.  I call them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Subsistence cooking</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Getting over it, and getting on with it</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Grilling season arrives</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"subsistence-cooking\">Subsistence cooking</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>So, I admit when we first got here, I went through a bit of culture shock.  As I’ve mentioned before, it was colder inside our flat than it was outside, and it was rainy, and dreary most of the time.  Our kitchen was, and still is, tiny and isolated from the rest of the flat.  The cutlery was dull, and the pots and pans old and dented.  We must have set aside 50 knives and a dozen pots and pans from the three flats to be disposed of.</p>\n<p>We made our first trip to a grocery store called Lidl, a german chain.  All of the ingredients were labelled in anything other than language.  There was little produce or fresh meat, and it was nowhere near our flat.  Next door to us is a small corner market, at the cash register is a young boy who ought to be in school but never is.  They have produce outside, but no fresh meat, and a totally random selection of dry goods.  There is a large supermarket about 1km away, and it has a lot of things.  Going to the Park Towers supermarket for the first time was like an adventure.  Taco shells!  A butcher, a cheese counter with Parmeggiano Reggiano, hot sauce, spices, asian ingredients.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first meal we cooked in the flat was a grilled cheese and ham sandwich.  Not regular ham but delicious prosciutto ham, and tomato soup.  Sound familiar?  I’ll bet that is the first thing that many people learn to cook.  I’ll bet it was two weeks before we cooked an evening meal in the flat.  In part because going out for dinner meant that we had some place warm and heated where we could go for a few hours before coming home and huddling under our covers.  The first true good meal I cooked was this pesto with chicken.  We quickly discovered that we don&rsquo;t care too much for pesto in a jar even this close to Italy.   We also learned that vegetables and fruits are much more seasonal here in Malta than in America.  So we had to wait a few weeks before basil came into season to make a good home made pesto.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"getting-over-it-getting-on-with-it\">Getting over it, Getting on with it</h2>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Eventually, the temperature warmed up and we got more comfortable with our surroundings and we reached the point where we could not stand to eat out anymore and so we started cooking in the flat more.  One of my goals was to learn at least one new recipe while we were in Malta. I figured it would be so me kind of seafood, but it turns out the Maltese don&rsquo;t really eat that much seafood despite living on an island. After our trip to Rome I realized that what I really wanted to cook was spaghetti carbonara. For some reason I have missed out on this delicious yet simple dish my entire life.   This is one of those simple yet delicious Italian dishes.  Eggs, wine, noodles, cheese, and good cured ham or bacon.  I have been making steady progress on mastering this dish, but I still have a ways to go before it will live up to that first night in Rome.</p>\n<p>The second thing that made a turnaround in our cooking was learning to shop.  Now there are four places that are worth highlighting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>O&rsquo;Ryan&rsquo;s on the corner</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The college street mini market (the green market)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>park towers supermarket</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Meats and Eats on Dingli</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>all the vegetable trucks</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s dispatch with Park Towers first.  Big, indifferent to rude staff, distant.  Shopped there a couple of times and decided not to go back.  Jane has been back a couple of times to stock up on cleaning and bathroom supplies, but we don&rsquo;t shop there anymore for groceries.</p>\n<p>The corner store is great for water, limoncello, Pringles, and the occasional need for baguette and salami.  It&rsquo;s about double the size of my living room, but packs in all of the essentials including frozen meats.  The owner and his family run it together. Nine times out of ten when you go in there you would think that the mother is on the verge of killing the father or the son. Or it might just be that most Arabic conversations still sound like arguments to my western ears.  Much of the time the cash register is &ldquo;manned&rdquo; by a boy who clearly should be in school but is not.  I suppose he will inherit the store and so is learning the trade and the family does not feel the need to send him to school.</p>\n<p>The green market is much larger than the corner store, and has great fresh baked bread every day.  They have a reasonable selection of fruits and vegetables out front, along with canned goods and other essentials.  Most of the time the cash register is manned by an old man who has never once rung up an entire order correctly, but he is charming and friendly every time we go to the store.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Meats and Eats is probably the single best thing that happened to my cooking during our stay in Malta. The store is bright and clean and staffed by a bunch of friendly Italians.  The meat counter is a joy to visit almost every day.  It&rsquo;s the kind of meat counter wher they have several big hunks of ribeye, originating from around the world, and they Will cut you off a hunk of whatever thickness you like.  They also have marinated pork and chicken and fresh minced beef and pork.  The rest of the store has great gourmet ingredients as well as some nice convince items like prepared curry sauce.  The cheese counter has huge chunks of parmigiana reggiano at a ridiculously low price.  Next to the checkout counter is a wine selection that is just about as good as anything you can find in Malta.</p>\n<p>I knew that I was going to have a great time shopping at Meats and Eats the morning I decided to give carbonara a try.  I went to the meat counter to get some bacon and had the following conversation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Clint:  Sorry sir, we only have streaky bacon today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Me: Uhhhhm streaky bacon?  <em>Ahh, the stuff that just looks like regular bacon to my eye.</em>  What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Clint:   Very thin, not the good cured pork belly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Me:  Oh,  well I&rsquo;m just experimenting with carbonara sauce so I think the streaky bacon will work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Clint:  Oh no sir, you should not do that. If you are doing carbonara you need the good bacon or one of the packages of pancetta in the case over there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh yes, agreed the lady standing next to me at the counter.   Now I am left wondering how I will find this wonderful chunky pancetta back home.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another thing I&rsquo;m excited about continuing back home is fried spring rolls!  Jane and I had lessons on making these in Vietnam,  and were excited to try our hand on our own.  When I discovered an Asian market on my walk to school I knew this would become a reality in Malta.  Shopping in the Asian market is like Christmas, I see all of these cool exotic ingredients and I want to get them and try them out.  Fresh lemon grass, six different kinds of fish sauce, Hoisin, Sirachi, you name it.  Now the key to good spring rolls in my opinion starts with the wrapper, and I definitely like the frozen wrappers much better than the dried.  They are easier to work with and I like the texture of the end product better.  With a little more practice I&rsquo;ll be ready to challenge my friend Nancy to a Spring Roll Throwdown!</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Sunday morning expedition to the Marsaxlokk  (Mar-sa-shlock) fish market provided an opportunity to learn how to fillet and cook fresh caught sea bass.  There are many other types of fish available at the market as well, but Jane and I had both watched a you-tube video on filleting sea bass, so that was the direction we went.  The market also has huge king prawns, but taking the head and legs off the prawns is a lot of work for my lunch.  One thing that amazed me about the fish market was that it was not the least bit fishy smelling.  In fact other than the fish market in the middle of Gzira I have yet to walk along the sea here in Malta and think, oh fishy, or ocean.  I guess it goes with the crystal clear water.</p>\n<p>One thing that we have really had to work on is finding variety in our diet.  Back home we enjoy the cuisine of many different countries all in the same week.  Tex-Mex one night, grilling the next, indian or Thai curry after that, italian, vietnamese, pot roast in the crock pot (an American Tagine),  you name it, we like our variety.  Making tacos is definitely a comfort food that we miss.  The ingredients are just about impossible to find.  Sour Cream and creme fresh are not the same,  The salsa here on the isaland is just not up to par.  Finding taco shells is possible at the Park Towers supermarket, but you have to go there to buy them.  Then there is the beef, or what the British and Maltese call <em>mince</em>  I suppose that if you look at it objectively <em>mince</em> is no worse of a word than <em>ground</em> but having grown up with ground beef,  minced beef sounds a little disgusting to my ears.</p>\n<p>The other odd thing is the lack of soups.  You simply cannot buy <strong>cream of mushroom</strong> anywhere!  So we have gone six months without one of the staple comfort dishes of my entire life, namely beef stroganhoff.  The availability of wonderful Parmiagianno Reggiano makes risotto a good comfort fill in, and here we run into the lack of chicken stock.  I suppose I could, and should, make my own stock but that takes advanced planning.  I&rsquo;m used to just grabbing a carton of stock from the coop to make my risotto.  Here it appears that boiled water with bullion cubes, or a little container of gelatinous chicken stock substance that you disolve in water takes the place of a good stock.  It does the trick, especially with a little extra Reggiano.</p>\n<p>And finally a word about wine.  Maltese wine is surprisingly good, and incredibly cheap.  While many of the students pride themselves on keeping it under 3 euros a bottle, I have found many good wines for under ten.  My favorites are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>ISIS, a rather unfortunate name for a wine in this day and age, but it really is my favorite</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maltese Falcon</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Marsamena &ndash; a delicious chardonnay from Gozo</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the subject of wine I would be totally remiss if I did not mention our local wine shop.  Owned and run by a young man from the south of France, Vini Culture is a fun place to stop in on my way home from school, or to just run  around the corner and grab a bottle for happy hour.  The young guy who runs the store is extremely friendly and pleasant.  I never stop in there without having an enjoyable conversation about wine and France and all the new things he has on order for us to try.  Its hard to understand how he makes a living in a specialty shop like that in the middle of Sliema but I&rsquo;m happy I got to know him and shop there.</p>\n<h2 id=\"grilling-season\">Grilling season</h2>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>And suddenly grilling season was upon us.   The roof was a much sunnier and less windy place.  The sun was starting to stay out until a reasonable cooking hour.  Meats and Eats has a wonderful pork steak marinated in mediterranean spices, and we can grill that and serve it with some roasted new potatoes from my Sicilian vegetable man.  Some fresh baked bread, and some spinach salad with strawberries and vinaigrette dressing.</p>\n<p>The Sicilian vegetable guy, I have no idea what his name is, is another great story.  Since meats and eats does not sell vegetables, I just walk another half block to this guys fresh vegetable truck.  I know he thinks I&rsquo;m kind of odd because I usually come in and buy one hot pepper, six small potatoes, or one head of garlic, depending on what I need for the evening meal.

It brought a huge transformation in the weather, and consequently my enjoyment of our time in Malta.

They have chicken marinated in three or four different marinades an so that provides us with a great variety of things to try.</p>\n<p>It is certainly true that you can learn a lot about a culture by its food.  Malta is definitely no different.  The Italian influence is obvious in the pizza and pasta restaurants that are everywhere.  Their national dish of Pastizzi is not my favorite, but has certainly become a cheap lunchtime staple for many of the students.    The traditional Maltese foods include rabbit, which is also quite good &ndash; especially the rabbit pie at Guze &ndash; and some other stuffed meat dishes.  There are turkish kebab and pizza places everywhere.  We think its an odd combination, and we wonder about all the kebab joints.  I think it must have to do with the influence of the Ottoman empire on the island long ago, but I may be completely wrong.  In general, it is a diet high in carbohydrates, which works for me, but drives Jane crazy.   Jane and I had one of those funny conversations back in January, where the question was if you had to give up variety, and live with one cuisine, which would it be?  Both of us chose Itialian or Vietnamese as our top two.  Then I was leaning toward Italian, but now I am looking forward to more of the fresh healthy variety offered by the Vietnamese.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "The first thing I should say about cooking in Malta is that there are around 600 reasons not to cook within walking distance.  Some of our favorites are:\n\n\n\n* Guzé — OK, I **love** Pappardelle with wild boar sauce.  I could eat this once a week.\n\n* Pepperoncino — The Rosettes (little bowls of pappardelle and proscuitto cooked in cream sauce) are to die for.  Plus a totally small town friendly vibe that you just can’t beat.\n\n* Piccolo Padre   -- Eat pizza right out over the water.  Diavola yum!\n\n* Wigi’s Kitchen — You can pick your fish or your steak right at the table.  The window seats have an awesome view of Balluta bay.\n\n* Kebabji. -- The students introduced us to this one.  I think of it as \"the chipotle of Sliema.\"  My favorite is Chicken-shish with Tabbouleh, Hummus, Couscous, Harissa, and Sesame sauce.   Actually its the only thing on the menu I've ever ordered, but why mess up a good thing.\n\n\n\nI’m going to divide the rest of this post into three parts, that roughly describe the three stages of cooking I have gone through here.  I call them:\n\n\n\n* Subsistence cooking\n\n* Getting over it, and getting on with it\n\n* Grilling season arrives\n\n\n\n## Subsistence cooking\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/70db2bd0cc.jpg\" width=400 >\n\n\n\nSo, I admit when we first got here, I went through a bit of culture shock.  As I’ve mentioned before, it was colder inside our flat than it was outside, and it was rainy, and dreary most of the time.  Our kitchen was, and still is, tiny and isolated from the rest of the flat.  The cutlery was dull, and the pots and pans old and dented.  We must have set aside 50 knives and a dozen pots and pans from the three flats to be disposed of.\n\n\n\nWe made our first trip to a grocery store called Lidl, a german chain.  All of the ingredients were labelled in anything other than language.  There was little produce or fresh meat, and it was nowhere near our flat.  Next door to us is a small corner market, at the cash register is a young boy who ought to be in school but never is.  They have produce outside, but no fresh meat, and a totally random selection of dry goods.  There is a large supermarket about 1km away, and it has a lot of things.  Going to the Park Towers supermarket for the first time was like an adventure.  Taco shells!  A butcher, a cheese counter with Parmeggiano Reggiano, hot sauce, spices, asian ingredients.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/546d07b6b5.jpg\" width=200 style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px\">The first meal we cooked in the flat was a grilled cheese and ham sandwich.  Not regular ham but delicious prosciutto ham, and tomato soup.  Sound familiar?  I’ll bet that is the first thing that many people learn to cook.  I’ll bet it was two weeks before we cooked an evening meal in the flat.  In part because going out for dinner meant that we had some place warm and heated where we could go for a few hours before coming home and huddling under our covers.  The first true good meal I cooked was this pesto with chicken.  We quickly discovered that we don't care too much for pesto in a jar even this close to Italy.   We also learned that vegetables and fruits are much more seasonal here in Malta than in America.  So we had to wait a few weeks before basil came into season to make a good home made pesto.\n\n\n\n<div style=\"float: clear\"></div>\n\n\n\n## Getting over it, Getting on with it\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/a7afe8793a.jpg\" width=200 style=\"float: right;\"> Eventually, the temperature warmed up and we got more comfortable with our surroundings and we reached the point where we could not stand to eat out anymore and so we started cooking in the flat more.  One of my goals was to learn at least one new recipe while we were in Malta. I figured it would be so me kind of seafood, but it turns out the Maltese don't really eat that much seafood despite living on an island. After our trip to Rome I realized that what I really wanted to cook was spaghetti carbonara. For some reason I have missed out on this delicious yet simple dish my entire life.   This is one of those simple yet delicious Italian dishes.  Eggs, wine, noodles, cheese, and good cured ham or bacon.  I have been making steady progress on mastering this dish, but I still have a ways to go before it will live up to that first night in Rome.\n\n\n\nThe second thing that made a turnaround in our cooking was learning to shop.  Now there are four places that are worth highlighting.\n\n\n\n* O'Ryan's on the corner\n\n* The college street mini market (the green market)\n\n* park towers supermarket\n\n* Meats and Eats on Dingli \n\n* all the vegetable trucks\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's dispatch with Park Towers first.  Big, indifferent to rude staff, distant.  Shopped there a couple of times and decided not to go back.  Jane has been back a couple of times to stock up on cleaning and bathroom supplies, but we don't shop there anymore for groceries. \n\n\n\nThe corner store is great for water, limoncello, Pringles, and the occasional need for baguette and salami.  It's about double the size of my living room, but packs in all of the essentials including frozen meats.  The owner and his family run it together. Nine times out of ten when you go in there you would think that the mother is on the verge of killing the father or the son. Or it might just be that most Arabic conversations still sound like arguments to my western ears.  Much of the time the cash register is \"manned\" by a boy who clearly should be in school but is not.  I suppose he will inherit the store and so is learning the trade and the family does not feel the need to send him to school. \n\n\n\nThe green market is much larger than the corner store, and has great fresh baked bread every day.  They have a reasonable selection of fruits and vegetables out front, along with canned goods and other essentials.  Most of the time the cash register is manned by an old man who has never once rung up an entire order correctly, but he is charming and friendly every time we go to the store.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e12a30631f.jpg\" width=200 style=\"float: left;\">Meats and Eats is probably the single best thing that happened to my cooking during our stay in Malta. The store is bright and clean and staffed by a bunch of friendly Italians.  The meat counter is a joy to visit almost every day.  It's the kind of meat counter wher they have several big hunks of ribeye, originating from around the world, and they Will cut you off a hunk of whatever thickness you like.  They also have marinated pork and chicken and fresh minced beef and pork.  The rest of the store has great gourmet ingredients as well as some nice convince items like prepared curry sauce.  The cheese counter has huge chunks of parmigiana reggiano at a ridiculously low price.  Next to the checkout counter is a wine selection that is just about as good as anything you can find in Malta. \n\n\n\nI knew that I was going to have a great time shopping at Meats and Eats the morning I decided to give carbonara a try.  I went to the meat counter to get some bacon and had the following conversation:\n\n> Clint:  Sorry sir, we only have streaky bacon today.  \n\n> Me: Uhhhhm streaky bacon?  *Ahh, the stuff that just looks like regular bacon to my eye.*  What's the difference? \n\n> Clint:   Very thin, not the good cured pork belly.  \n\n> Me:  Oh,  well I'm just experimenting with carbonara sauce so I think the streaky bacon will work.   \n\n> Clint:  Oh no sir, you should not do that. If you are doing carbonara you need the good bacon or one of the packages of pancetta in the case over there.  \n\nOh yes, agreed the lady standing next to me at the counter.   Now I am left wondering how I will find this wonderful chunky pancetta back home.  \n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5e6841a178.jpg\" width=200 style=\"float: right;\">Another thing I'm excited about continuing back home is fried spring rolls!  Jane and I had lessons on making these in Vietnam,  and were excited to try our hand on our own.  When I discovered an Asian market on my walk to school I knew this would become a reality in Malta.  Shopping in the Asian market is like Christmas, I see all of these cool exotic ingredients and I want to get them and try them out.  Fresh lemon grass, six different kinds of fish sauce, Hoisin, Sirachi, you name it.  Now the key to good spring rolls in my opinion starts with the wrapper, and I definitely like the frozen wrappers much better than the dried.  They are easier to work with and I like the texture of the end product better.  With a little more practice I'll be ready to challenge my friend Nancy to a Spring Roll Throwdown!\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/a20fec71f7.jpg\" width=200 style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px;\">A Sunday morning expedition to the Marsaxlokk  (Mar-sa-shlock) fish market provided an opportunity to learn how to fillet and cook fresh caught sea bass.  There are many other types of fish available at the market as well, but Jane and I had both watched a you-tube video on filleting sea bass, so that was the direction we went.  The market also has huge king prawns, but taking the head and legs off the prawns is a lot of work for my lunch.  One thing that amazed me about the fish market was that it was not the least bit fishy smelling.  In fact other than the fish market in the middle of Gzira I have yet to walk along the sea here in Malta and think, oh fishy, or ocean.  I guess it goes with the crystal clear water.\n\n\n\nOne thing that we have really had to work on is finding variety in our diet.  Back home we enjoy the cuisine of many different countries all in the same week.  Tex-Mex one night, grilling the next, indian or Thai curry after that, italian, vietnamese, pot roast in the crock pot (an American Tagine),  you name it, we like our variety.  Making tacos is definitely a comfort food that we miss.  The ingredients are just about impossible to find.  Sour Cream and creme fresh are not the same,  The salsa here on the isaland is just not up to par.  Finding taco shells is possible at the Park Towers supermarket, but you have to go there to buy them.  Then there is the beef, or what the British and Maltese call *mince*  I suppose that if you look at it objectively *mince* is no worse of a word than *ground* but having grown up with ground beef,  minced beef sounds a little disgusting to my ears. \n\n\n\nThe other odd thing is the lack of soups.  You simply cannot buy **cream of mushroom** anywhere!  So we have gone six months without one of the staple comfort dishes of my entire life, namely beef stroganhoff.  The availability of wonderful Parmiagianno Reggiano makes risotto a good comfort fill in, and here we run into the lack of chicken stock.  I suppose I could, and should, make my own stock but that takes advanced planning.  I'm used to just grabbing a carton of stock from the coop to make my risotto.  Here it appears that boiled water with bullion cubes, or a little container of gelatinous chicken stock substance that you disolve in water takes the place of a good stock.  It does the trick, especially with a little extra Reggiano.\n\n\n\nAnd finally a word about wine.  Maltese wine is surprisingly good, and incredibly cheap.  While many of the students pride themselves on keeping it under 3 euros a bottle, I have found many good wines for under ten.  My favorites are:\n\n\n\n* ISIS, a rather unfortunate name for a wine in this day and age, but it really is my favorite\n\n* Maltese Falcon\n\n* Marsamena -- a delicious chardonnay from Gozo\n\n\n\nOn the subject of wine I would be totally remiss if I did not mention our local wine shop.  Owned and run by a young man from the south of France, Vini Culture is a fun place to stop in on my way home from school, or to just run  around the corner and grab a bottle for happy hour.

Of course the first thing that happens when you have a page hosted on <code>static-site</code> that makes an xhr request to <code>ajax-server</code> is that you get an error.   Browsers and sites work together to disallow cross-domain requests to prevent a variety of nasty behaviors.  But, there are many times (wlike now) when you have a legitimate reason for doing this.  So, the w3c created the Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) standard to help developers get around this.  Cory Dolphin has created an excellent plugin for <a href=\"flask.pocoo.org\">Flask</a> developers called <a href=\"http://github.com/corydolphin/flask-cors\">Flask-CORS</a>.  The plugin is a great example of the brilliant design behind Flask and in fact the entire WSGI stack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-really-simple-approach\">The Really Simple Approach</h2>\n<p>The first thing you find when you start googling about this problem is that there is a seemingly simple solution.  If you have control over your AJAX response you simply need to add an HTTP header <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>  problem solved.  Now everyone in the world can make xhr requests to your server and use the results in their page.</p>\n<p>Adding a header is pretty simple in Flask.  All you need to do is use <code>response.headers.add(&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot;, &quot;*&quot;</code>   Problem solved, moving right along to the next programming challenge.</p>\n<p>Or maybe not.   Minutes later you realize that this is not all that great because you have decorated some of your requests to require a login.  That wont be a problem if the static page is served from the same domain because you will automatically get the session cookie, and the Flask-Security extension will eat that cooking and validate things for you.  BUT if your static page is not served from the same domain you will not even get the session cookie.  Oh Bother.  But you also have a second problem.  You have probably violated the CORS specification without even meaning to.  Really, if I had to read the spec for every web standard I wanted to use I would seriously think about changing careers.  But, <strong>here is the important part</strong> you may not return a CORS header unless the request contains an origin header!  Chances are you tested you change with a quick <code>curl</code> call to your endpoint, saw the Access-Control header and were happy.  But you sure didn’t give it an origin header on the request when you did that.  So to summarize, we have two problems we need to solve:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We want to incorporate authentication into our cross origin strategy.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We want to be good citizens and follow the spec.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"the-smart-approach\">The Smart Approach</h2>\n<p>The smart approach is to use a nice extension where <em>other</em> people have figured this out, and presumably followed the specification. Enter Flask-CORS.  You can enable CORS support with a simple decorator <code>@cross_origin</code>  This will automatically add the  <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code> to responses.  <strong>As long as your test request includes an Origin</strong>.  If you are like me you will forget that part, and then wonder why the extension must not be working.  So this solves problem 2.</p>\n<p>To solve problem 1 here is a snippet of code that works just fine.</p>\n<pre><code>@ajax.route('/ajax/page')\n\n@login_required\n\n@cross_origin(supports_credentials=True)\n\ndef test():\n\n    return jsonify({'foo':'bar'})\n</code></pre>\n<p>The above responds to the url <code>/ajax/page</code>  I have all of my API calls in an <code>ajax</code> blueprint with ajax as part of the url.  I’m requiring that the user is logged in before I allow them to access this endpoint.  I also want it to be allowed cross origin.  This is where the parameter to the <code>@cross_origin</code> comes into play.  Supports credentials sets up the CORS response to return an additional CORS header:  <code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:  &quot;true&quot;</code>.  For one final twist, you need to know that when you have <code>supports_credentials=True</code> you may NOT set <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>  You need to be specific and set the origin to the origin that comes in the request headers.  To Make this work and try it out from the client side, here is a bit of HTML/Javascript.</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;button onclick=&quot;corsTest();&quot;&gt;TestCORS&lt;/button&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n\n    function corsTest() {\n\n        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n        xhr.withCredentials = true;\n\n        xhr.onload = function () {\n\n            alert(xhr.responseText);\n\n        }\n\n        xhr.onerror = function () {\n\n            alert(&quot;error&quot;);\n\n        }\n\n\n\n        xhr.open(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;http://example.com/ajax/page&quot;, true)\n\n        xhr.send()\n\n    }\n\n&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that you need to set <code>xhr.withCredentials</code> in order for your session cookie to be sent along.  By default cookies are NOT sent with cross origin requests.</p>\n<p>Now, I may end up adding more to this as I discover the intricacies of so called “Non-Simple” requests.  That is requests beyond simple GET and POST, as I work on moving my API toward a RESTful API which uses PUT and others.  This will nodoubt enlighten me about preflighted requests.  Which I can only assume means something different than sitting around in an airport bar waiting for your flight to be called.</p>\n<p>There is a lot more detail and background on using CORS at the following two sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS\">The Mozilla Developer Network</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://flask-cors.readthedocs.org\">Flask-CORS documentation</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

We want to be good citizens and follow the spec.\n\n\n\n## The Smart Approach\n\nThe smart approach is to use a nice extension where _other_ people have figured this out, and presumably followed the specification. Enter Flask-CORS.  You can enable CORS support with a simple decorator `@cross_origin`  This will automatically add the  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` to responses.  **As long as your test request includes an Origin**.  If you are like me you will forget that part, and then wonder why the extension must not be working.  So this solves problem 2.\n\n\n\nTo solve problem 1 here is a snippet of code that works just fine.\n\n\n\n\t@ajax.route('/ajax/page')\n\n\t@login_required\n\n\t@cross_origin(supports_credentials=True)\n\n\tdef test():\n\n\t    return jsonify({'foo':'bar'})\n\n\n\nThe above responds to the url `/ajax/page`  I have all of my API calls in an `ajax` blueprint with ajax as part of the url.  I’m requiring that the user is logged in before I allow them to access this endpoint.  I also want it to be allowed cross origin.  This is where the parameter to the `@cross_origin` comes into play.  Supports credentials sets up the CORS response to return an additional CORS header:  `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:  \"true\"`.  For one final twist, you need to know that when you have `supports_credentials=True` you may NOT set `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`  You need to be specific and set the origin to the origin that comes in the request headers.  To Make this work and try it out from the client side, here is a bit of HTML/Javascript.\n\n \n\n\t<button onclick=\"corsTest();\">TestCORS</button>\n\n\t\n\n\t<script>\n\n\t    function corsTest() {\n\n\t        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n\t        xhr.withCredentials = true;\n\n\t        xhr.onload = function () {\n\n\t            alert(xhr.responseText);\n\n\t        }\n\n\t        xhr.onerror = function () {\n\n\t            alert(\"error\");\n\n\t        }\n\n\t\n\n\t        xhr.open(\"GET\", \"http://example.com/ajax/page\", true)\n\n\t        xhr.send()\n\n\t    }\n\n\t</script>\n\n\n\nNote that you need to set `xhr.withCredentials` in order for your session cookie to be sent along.  By default cookies are NOT sent with cross origin requests.\n\n\n\nNow, I may end up adding more to this as I discover the intricacies of so called “Non-Simple” requests.  That is requests beyond simple GET and POST, as I work on moving my API toward a RESTful API which uses PUT and others.  This will nodoubt enlighten me about preflighted requests.  Which I can only assume means something different than sitting around in an airport bar waiting for your flight to be called.\n\n\n\nThere is a lot more detail and background on using CORS at the following two sites:\n\n\n\n* [The Mozilla Developer Network][5]\n\n* [Flask-CORS documentation][6]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]:\thttp://github.com/bnmnetp/runestone/wiki/DevelopmentRoadmap\n\n[2]:\tinteractivepython.org\n\n[3]:\tflask.pocoo.org\n\n[4]:\thttp://github.com/corydolphin/flask-cors\n\n[5]:\thttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS\n\n[6]:\thttp://flask-cors.readthedocs.org\n",

The index.rst file is the table of contents for your entire project.

				"content_text": "\n\n\nAs part of the grand reorganization of the various tools and software associated with the [Runestone Interactive][1] project I am planning to also write a series of tutorials to help people get started.  The major aspects of this reorganization are discussed in detail in the [Project Roadmap][2], but for the sake of some context I can summarize the major efforts as follows:\n\n\n\n1.  Separate the distribution and development of writing tools from the server.\n\n\t1.  Make a pip installable runestone package.\n\n\t2. Remove the interconnectedness between the components and Sphinx.  In other words support the user of runestone tools in environments like Markdown, and even wysiwyg html editors.\n\n\n\n2. Re-architect the server side focusing on services for the writing tools\n\n\t1.    Create an authentication service that supports CORS for cross domain AJAX use.\n\n\t2.    Create a standard REST API for logging and storing student data\n\n\n\n3.  Create a web application (or integrate with another) for grading\n\n\n\nSince I just completed Part 1.1 I thought it was a good time to talk about how easy it is for you to now use the runestone tools for creating a lab for your students, or lecture notes and presentation materials for your class.\n\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n\n\nThe major steps in getting started are \n\n\n\n* Installing Python\n\n* Installing the runestone tools\n\n* Building your first lab\n\n\n\n### Install Python\n\n\n\n1.  If you are on a Mac you are already done with this step.\n\n2.  If you are on Windows you will need to go to [Python.org][3] and download Python3.x.   The windows installer is a typical installer and you can just click your way through it.\n\n\n\nIf you are an advanced Python user you may want to may want to create a `virtualenvironment` for this project but it is not a requirement.\n\n\n\nIf you are on Windows you may want to edit your PATH environment variable following the instructions [here][4].  Again, mac users can ignore this.\n\n\n\n### Installing the Runestone Components\n\n\n\nYou are going to need to use the command line for the rest of this tutorial, so start up a [Terminal][5]   (/Applications/Utilities on a Mac  or run [PowerShell][6] or cmd.exe on Windows)  I will repeat myself here.  These commands need to be run from the command line, **not** from the Python shell.\n\n\n\nRun the `pip` command\n\n\n\n\t$ pip install runestone\n\n\n\nOr on Windows if you have not modified  your PATH try:\n\n\n\n\tC:\\\\Python34\\Scripts\\pip.exe install runestone\n\n\n\nFrom now on I'm only going to give the Mac way of running the commands.  If you are on windows you will need to add `C:\\\\Python34\\Scripts` to the beginning of the command and add `.exe` to the end.\n\n\n\nYou can watch as a lot of text goes scrolling by.  But as long as you don't get any errors you should be good to go.  You only need to do these first two steps once.  Once you have installed Python and runestone you will not have to do it again.\n\n\n\n### Starting your first Runestone Project\n\n\n\nHere is a session of me on my computer creating a simple project.\n\n\n\n\t$ mkdir mynewproject\n\n\t$ cd mynewproject\n\n\t$ runestone init\n\n\t\n\n\tThis will create a new Runestone project in your current directory.\n\n\tDo you want to proceed?  [Y/n]: y\n\n\tNext we need to gather a few pieces of information to create your configuration files\n\n\tProject name: (one word, no spaces): myhello\n\n\tpath to build dir  [./build]:\n\n\trequire login   [false]:\n\n\tURL for ajax server  [http://127.0.0.1:8000]:\n\n\tYour Name  [bmiller]: Brad Miller\n\n\tTitle for this project  [Runestone Default]: My Hello World\n\n\tLog student actions?  [True]: False\n\n\tDone.  Type runestone build to build your project\n\n\n\nAt this point you will have the following files and folders:\n\n\n\n\tmynewproject/\n\n\t        _static/\n\n\t        _sources    \n\n\t        _templates  \n\n\t        conf.py\n\n\t        pavement.py\n\n\n\n* The `_static` folder is for things like images or javscript files.\n\n* The `_sources` folder is where you will put your own writing.  To start with there are a couple of examples files for you.\n\n* The `_templates` folder is for styling.  There is a default set of templates that match the runestone interactive look and feel.  That is a good thing to start with.  Once you become more familiar with the system you may want to customize the templates or even make your own.\n\n* The `conf.py` file is used by Sphinx, and contains information from some of the questions you answered when you initialized your project.\n\n* The `pavement.py` file is used for building and setting build parameters.\n\n\n\nAll of these files are important, and you should not delete any of them.\n\n\n\nNext run `runestone build`  This command will create a build/mynewproject folder with an index.html file in it.  If you want you can now run `runestone serve` and then go to your browser and open up the following URL  `http://localhost:8000/index.html`   Yay!  You have a webpage.  Feel free to explore a bit to get an idea about some of the components you can use in your lab.\n\n\n\n### Writing your Own Lab\n\n\n\nOK, lets edit  `_sources/index.rst`   Initially it looks like this:\n\n\n\n\t=====================\n\n\tThis Is A New Project\n\n\t=====================\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\tSECTION 1: Introduction\n\n\t:::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n\t\n\n\tCongratulations!

You have created a very nice little lesson without a lot of hassle.  The Runestone and Sphinx tools take care of all of the formatting for you!\n\n\n\n## Giving Students Browser Access to the Lab\n\n\n\nIf you have your own webpage hosted on a school server that you normally use for class you can make your Lab available to the students by simply taking the folder `mynewproject` inside the `build` folder and putting that on your website.  The folder is self contained and can be hosted on any web server.  \n\n\n\nIf you know the IP Address of your own computer and you simply want to give let students bring up the webpage from your computer you can do that too.

I'll cover at least one of them in another tutorial.  In fact I think I see a whole series of tutorials in the future on topics such as:\n\n\n\n* Making an online quiz for class\n\n* Making a lecture or presentation \n\n* Hosting your lab or quiz on **github pages** or another online service\n\n* Using your lab with runestone services\n\n\n\n\n\n[1]:\thttp://runestoneinteractive.org\n\n[2]:\thttps://github.com/bnmnetp/runestone/wiki/DevelopmentRoadmap\n\n[3]:\thttp://python.org\n\n[4]:\thttps://docs.python.org/3.4/using/windows.html\n\n[5]:\thttp://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line\n\n[6]:\thttp://www.tomshardware.co.uk/faq/id-1656450/windows-powershell-feature.html\n\n[7]:\thttp://getnikola.com/quickstart.html\n",

I will give you an appetizer and  free baklava for desert!&rdquo;  <em>Really?  I honestly don&rsquo;t remember you.  I&rsquo;ve only walked down this road one other time.</em>  &ldquo;Very Sorry&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already got a dinner reservation back at Ocean&rsquo;s 7. &quot;  &ldquo;you will like it!&rdquo; Says one of the patrons at the current establishment.  Another ten steps down the road and we are implored to &ldquo;Look at my menu.&rdquo;  A bit further on we are told  &ldquo;Sir, I have your table ready for you!&rdquo; The idea that you can bargain for your supper seems so counter productive to me that I just cannot fathom it.  Hey, lets see how little I can pay for something I&rsquo;m about to ingest into my body.  The incentives here are all in the wrong direction!</p>\n<p>I can only imagine the conversations in the kitchen:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Waiter:</em>   One chicken and rice for the cheapskates at table five!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Chef:</em>  Oh great, now we know what to do with the gizzard and thigh meat that has been sitting on the floor all night!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>No Thank You</strong>  I will be more than happy to pay a price that puts the chef on my side.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Waiter:</em>  Chef the generous folks are back at table seven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Chef:</em>  Great, tell them to order the veal, I&rsquo;ve got two extra tender pieces I&rsquo;ve been saving for my best customers.  Oh, and bring up that 2011 Rombaur Chardonnay from the cellar, I know they will love that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think we can all agree on which chef we would rather have cooking our food.</p>\n<p>This whole hawking the restaurant thing has been an ongoing saga since we arrived in Istanbul, and we even experienced it in London a couple of weekends ago.  I don&rsquo;t remember it being the case in Vietnam or Morocco, and certainly not in Malta,  but maybe this has more to do with the onset of high touring season than our location.   Now, this is not really a scam  (although we have heard stories of the old bait and switch ) so much as an intro to  the two things that happened to us today.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cruising-on-a-reputable-ferry\">Cruising on a Reputable Ferry</h2>\n<p>Our plan for the day was to take the Ferry up the Bosphorus river to the mouth of the Black Sea.  You get to see a lot of Istanbul along the way, then the ferry stops for a couple of hours so you can have lunch or do a little hiking and then comes back.  As usual Jane had it all planned out, including a discount for using our museum passes.  When we arrived at the waterfront we were immediately accosted by the usual crowd of tour people trying to sell us one of their packages.  &ndash; two hour boat trips, three hour boat trips, six hour boat trips&hellip;  &ldquo;No, we are going on the ferry!&rdquo; we would say.  &ldquo;But I can leave sooner.  I will take you to the same place, wait for two hours and bring you back.  My boat holds 80, it will be much nicer than the ferry and 800 people!&rdquo;  Hmmm, we were intrigued, and a bit horrified that we were even considering this option.  But after a bit of negotiation, and multiple confirmations about our destination and pricing we decided to risk it.  The captain even threw in a 50% discount on coffee at the nearby snack shack.  Run by a relative no doubt.  &ldquo;Just wait here&rdquo; we were told.  So we waited and watched them try to work their magic on other passersby.</p>\n<p>After a while, one of them came up to talk to us.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We cannot take you.  I cannot do the trip for just your group.  It will be better if you take the ferry, down there.  There are not enough passengers today, because the bike race is keeping them all away from here.  I am sorry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It was true, there was a big Tour of Istanbul bike race in town, and the weather was a bit dreary, so the pier was sparsely populated.  Which also meant that the ferry was not nearly as crowded as Jane&rsquo;s research had led us to believe it would be.  So, we carried on with our original plan, got our tickets to the ferry and were on our way.</p>\n<p>The cruise was interesting, we got to see some castles, and some amazing real estate.  And even a container ship that originated from Valletta!  We just can&rsquo;t get away from Malta now.  Here is a little slideshow of some photos on the tour.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<pre><code>data-cycle-fx=scrollHorz\n\ndata-cycle-auto-height=container\n\ndata-cycle-caption=&quot;#bosphorus-caption&quot;\n\ndata-cycle-caption-template=&quot;Slide {{slideNum}}: {{cycleTitle}}&quot;&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"the-shoeshine-redemption\">The shoeshine redemption</h2>\n<p>After the cruise we had to make our way back into the spice market to buy some of the delicious candy covered &ldquo;fistik.&rdquo;  That is peanuts covered in a syrup and rolled in sesame seeds.  We discovered these our last day in Morocco, and were only too happy to find out you can buy them in Turkey as well.  Some of the group wanted to hit the archeological museum while others just wanted to wander the spice market some more.  So we turned them loose and decided to wander our own way back to the hotel.</p>\n<p>As we were passing up one street that was very lightly travelled a shoe shine man dropped his brush in front of us.  So, we picked it up and called out to him to give it back.  He thanked us and we were on our way.  Suddenly he called back to us.  He sat down and and said &ldquo;please,&rdquo;  with a look that said let me repay your kindness.   We thought how nice, one good turn deserves another.  But I had on my hiking shoes, which are not &ldquo;shineable&rdquo; and so he offered to shine Jane&rsquo;s black shoes which were definitely in need of some love after all of our travels.  He finished up Jane&rsquo;s shoes and then insisted on brushing mine with a toothbrush and some water &ndash; which certainly did not hurt.  About this time both Jane and I reached into our pockets for a few coins to tip the guy.</p>\n<p>Imagine my surprise when Jane offered him several one lyra coins and he said &ldquo;no, paper&rdquo;  What?  He doesn&rsquo;t want coins he wants paper money?  Slowly it dawned on me that we had been played this whole time.  He now wanted to be paid the full amount for two shoe shines, which took less than a couple of minutes.  I added my coins to Jane&rsquo;s and dumped them in his hand and we turned and walked away.  I guess we both got half price shoe shines, and nine turkish lyra (about $3).  Lesson learned, and a small price to pay for a story to add to the blog.</p>\n",

Another ten steps down the road and we are implored to \"Look at my menu.\"  A bit further on we are told  \"Sir, I have your table ready for you!\" The idea that you can bargain for your supper seems so counter productive to me that I just cannot fathom it.  Hey, lets see how little I can pay for something I'm about to ingest into my body.  The incentives here are all in the wrong direction!\n\n\n\n  I can only imagine the conversations in the kitchen:\n\n  \n\n  > *Waiter:*   One chicken and rice for the cheapskates at table five!   \n\n  \n\n  > *Chef:*  Oh great, now we know what to do with the gizzard and thigh meat that has been sitting on the floor all night! \n\n  \n\n  **No Thank You**  I will be more than happy to pay a price that puts the chef on my side.  \n\n  \n\n  > *Waiter:*  Chef the generous folks are back at table seven.  \n\n  \n\n  > *Chef:*  Great, tell them to order the veal, I've got two extra tender pieces I've been saving for my best customers.  Oh, and bring up that 2011 Rombaur Chardonnay from the cellar, I know they will love that.\n\n  \n\nI think we can all agree on which chef we would rather have cooking our food.\n\n\n\nThis whole hawking the restaurant thing has been an ongoing saga since we arrived in Istanbul, and we even experienced it in London a couple of weekends ago.  I don't remember it being the case in Vietnam or Morocco, and certainly not in Malta,  but maybe this has more to do with the onset of high touring season than our location.   Now, this is not really a scam  (although we have heard stories of the old bait and switch ) so much as an intro to  the two things that happened to us today.\n\n\n\n## Cruising on a Reputable Ferry\n\n\n\nOur plan for the day was to take the Ferry up the Bosphorus river to the mouth of the Black Sea.  You get to see a lot of Istanbul along the way, then the ferry stops for a couple of hours so you can have lunch or do a little hiking and then comes back.  As usual Jane had it all planned out, including a discount for using our museum passes.  When we arrived at the waterfront we were immediately accosted by the usual crowd of tour people trying to sell us one of their packages.  -- two hour boat trips, three hour boat trips, six hour boat trips...  \"No, we are going on the ferry!\" we would say.  \"But I can leave sooner.  I will take you to the same place, wait for two hours and bring you back.  My boat holds 80, it will be much nicer than the ferry and 800 people!\"  Hmmm, we were intrigued, and a bit horrified that we were even considering this option.  But after a bit of negotiation, and multiple confirmations about our destination and pricing we decided to risk it.  The captain even threw in a 50% discount on coffee at the nearby snack shack.  Run by a relative no doubt.  \"Just wait here\" we were told.  So we waited and watched them try to work their magic on other passersby.\n\n\n\nAfter a while, one of them came up to talk to us.  \n\n\n\n> We cannot take you.  I cannot do the trip for just your group.  It will be better if you take the ferry, down there.  There are not enough passengers today, because the bike race is keeping them all away from here.  I am sorry.\n\n\n\nIt was true, there was a big Tour of Istanbul bike race in town, and the weather was a bit dreary, so the pier was sparsely populated.  Which also meant that the ferry was not nearly as crowded as Jane's research had led us to believe it would be.  So, we carried on with our original plan, got our tickets to the ferry and were on our way.  \n\n\n\nThe cruise was interesting, we got to see some castles, and some amazing real estate.  And even a container ship that originated from Valletta!  We just can't get away from Malta now.  Here is a little slideshow of some photos on the tour.\n\n\n\n<div class=\"cycle-slideshow\" \n\n    data-cycle-fx=scrollHorz\n\n    data-cycle-auto-height=container\n\n    data-cycle-caption=\"#bosphorus-caption\"\n\n    data-cycle-caption-template=\"Slide {{slideNum}}: {{cycleTitle}}\">\n\n    \n\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6a80596414.jpg\" data-cycle-title=\"\">\n\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9560a1d242.jpg\" data-cycle-title=\"\">\n\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cacc167e5f.jpg\" data-cycle-title=\"\">\n\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/da6e906370.jpg\" data-cycle-title=\"\">\n\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/38391d5a88.jpg\" data-cycle-title=\"\">\n\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6e3b1891a3.jpg\" data-cycle-title=\"\">\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"bosphorus-caption\" class=\"center\"></div>\n\n<br />\n\n\n\n## The shoeshine redemption\n\n\n\nAfter the cruise we had to make our way back into the spice market to buy some of the delicious candy covered \"fistik.\"  That is peanuts covered in a syrup and rolled in sesame seeds.  We discovered these our last day in Morocco, and were only too happy to find out you can buy them in Turkey as well.  Some of the group wanted to hit the archeological museum while others just wanted to wander the spice market some more.  So we turned them loose and decided to wander our own way back to the hotel.\n\n\n\nAs we were passing up one street that was very lightly travelled a shoe shine man dropped his brush in front of us.  So, we picked it up and called out to him to give it back.  He thanked us and we were on our way.  Suddenly he called back to us.  He sat down and and said \"please,\"  with a look that said let me repay your kindness.   We thought how nice, one good turn deserves another.  But I had on my hiking shoes, which are not \"shineable\" and so he offered to shine Jane's black shoes which were definitely in need of some love after all of our travels.  He finished up Jane's shoes and then insisted on brushing mine with a toothbrush and some water -- which certainly did not hurt.  About this time both Jane and I reached into our pockets for a few coins to tip the guy.\n\n\n\nImagine my surprise when Jane offered him several one lyra coins and he said \"no, paper\"  What?  He doesn't want coins he wants paper money?  Slowly it dawned on me that we had been played this whole time.  He now wanted to be paid the full amount for two shoe shines, which took less than a couple of minutes.  I added my coins to Jane's and dumped them in his hand and we turned and walked away.  I guess we both got half price shoe shines, and nine turkish lyra (about $3).  Lesson learned, and a small price to pay for a story to add to the blog.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>The first words I read as my phone synced up email in the passport control line at Luton were &ldquo;still no tickets.&rdquo;  The message went on to explain that the tickets were still supposed to be delivered by eleven PM  by someone named Jamie who is running behind schedule.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1b7732109c.jpg\" alt=\"Wembley Stadium\"></p>\n<p>Getting tickets to the FA cup game is no easy trick.  All of the tickets allocated to both clubs (Arsenal and Reading) were sold out to season ticket holders well in advance, so visitors like us are left trying to buy tickets online from third parties at crazy high prices.  Yes, its crazy to pay over $300 to go to a soccer match.  Yes, I paid it willingly!  We  did some research, so we think this is a reputable source of tickets but you have to put a certain amount of trust in strangers in order to get your tickets.</p>\n<p>After the train ride into Farringdon station we walk over to the apartment we had rented through AirBnB, another exercise in trusting strangers, and are rewarded with exactly the fantastic two bedroom apartment we were promised.  The owner met us at the door and showed us around.  He had purchased us some breakfast items, and some fruit, and a nice bottle of wine.  The apartment is on a Kings Mews street, which is nice and quiet so no problem with street noise either.</p>\n<p>Jim and Josh arrived a few minutes later with Jim&rsquo;s luggage.  We got a two bedroom so we could share with Jim and so he would not have to spend the entire long weekend in Josh&rsquo;s student housing.  Which after seeing it, I am glad we did!</p>\n<p>As 11:00 came and went, we still had no tickets.  So we were preparing ourselves for the worst, which is really not too bad considering our apartment has a 56 inch big screen for the backup plan.

By 9:00 the next morning, we got the good news that we had tickets in hand.  The problem was that  they were not in the category we had paid for.  They were not bad tickets!  In fact they were really good.  Row 8 on the first level, but they were in the corner so we would be looking at the field the long way.  Since the website said tickets were fully refundable if you did not receive tickets in the category you paid for you were eligible for a full refund.  So we got online and complained a bit.  The first response was that we had been upgraded, and that these were actually better tickets than we had ordered <strong>for this game</strong>.   LOL.</p>\n<p>Shortly after this conversation we received a call saying that they had tickets for us in the area we had ordered.  However these were way up in the nosebleed area, and we would be split two and two.  about this same time we also noticed that two of our tickets had post-it notes attached with the note that they were Junior tickets.   Hmmm, maybe we got the wrong tickets?  Maybe they need to swap with us to get these to some guy and his two kids.   Well, we reasoned, we don&rsquo;t have to meet this guy and get the other tickets, possession is 90% of the law.  So we began to think about breakfast.  But before we all met up for breakfast,  we got an email from Karen, who had been woken up at 3AM back in the US by a call from Thomas, who wanted us to call him on his mobile.</p>\n<p>It turned out that Thomas also had tickets, but said they  were &ldquo;VIP tickets.&rdquo;  Karmic payback for being &ldquo;one of the kindest people I spoke to in this chat support ever&rdquo;?    Maybe!  Two of these new tickets included access to a table in the Bobby Moore hospitality area (free pre-game meal and drinks), and two of them were &ldquo;merely&rdquo; on the Wembly Gold (free budweiser at halftime) level.   So, in less than 12 hours we had gone from zero tickets to tickets that were beyond anything we could have imagined.  These tickets would be delivered to us by another delivery person, and then we were to meet Thomas near Wembly to return the four we originally had received.  The new courier arrived at our apartment in a shiny white Range Rover, and delivered our packets of tickets.  They all looked legit, and we all had great seats right on the halfway line!   Now all we had to do was find Thomas and hand over the old tickets.  Those young children might get to see the game with their dad yet.</p>\n<p>As we made the walk from the Wembley tube station towards the stadium we had many opportunities to sell our four extras.  We thought that we might even make a profit, but our honesty and the fact that we had VIP tickets in hand, put us in the mood to  carry on to our meeting point and keep up our end of the bargain.  It is interesting to think about the business model and operations of a third party ticket seller.  They are selling the tickets to us at a significant markup, but the tickets have to come from somewhere.  So they have to be able to forecast in advance how many tickets from each area they will probably have, and then they need to get those tickets from the original owners to the new buyers.  Its no wonder a lot of the transactions come down to the wire.</p>\n<p>Our tickets allowed us into the stadium well in advance of the game so we had plenty of time to soak up the atmosphere and check out all of our food, beverage and gift shop options.  As we were standing in the gift shop I saw one young man in Reading blue from head to toe, with a big foam blue finger call out to his dad.  His voice was shaking with excitement as his big blue finger pointed to a rack of merchandise.  LIVERPOOL he said with longing.  The dad just melted into the ground.  I guess you can&rsquo;t control who your kids will choose for their football team, even in England.</p>\n<p>As a fan of the Men in Blazers show, I was very excited to see that meat pies were available everywhere in the stadium.  Tom&rsquo;s pies to be exact.  So I enjoyed a very nice Guinness and roast beef pie as a pre-game meal.  It is true, they are quite good.  flakey crust, stringy tender roast beef and gravy on the inside, just like Sunday dinner back home.  So, here is the obligatory food shot!  You might also notice the betting sheet on the left side of the photo.  You can bet on almost anything right there at the game.  Final score, who will score, when will they score, who will score first, etc.  It was too complicated for us so we left the betting up to others and saved our money for sausages and more food later.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/60cd500bdd.jpg\" alt=\"beef pie\"></p>\n<p>The game itself turned out to be good.  It wasn&rsquo;t Arsenal&rsquo;s best performance of the year.  But I blame that on Wenger for going away from the lineup that had us winning nine in a row.  I would not have substituted Welbeck for Giroud, but I am not the manager.   Nevertheless Alexis scored a great goal just before halftime and I was feeling good.  A strong pep talk in the locker room and surely we would come out and seal the game with a couple more goals.  It turned out that the opposite happened.  Reading came out fired up and scored an equalizer, and we looked like we were playing &ldquo;not to lose&rdquo;  which is our worst strategy.   At the end of regulation it was Arsenal 1 - 1 Reading.   OVERTIME!  We were really getting our moneys worth out of these great seats.  As long as we win in overtime and don&rsquo;t go to penalties life is good  Which is what happened.  shortly before the end of the first extra period Alexis scored again.  It was kind of a sad screw up for the Reading keeper, but a victory is a victory!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/80e91bfa09.jpg\" alt=\"Corner Kick\"></p>\n<p>On to the FA Cup Final!</p>\n",
				"content_text": "The first words I read as my phone synced up email in the passport control line at Luton were \"still no tickets.\"  The message went on to explain that the tickets were still supposed to be delivered by eleven PM  by someone named Jamie who is running behind schedule.  \n\n\n\n![Wembley Stadium](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1b7732109c.jpg)\n\n\n\nGetting tickets to the FA cup game is no easy trick.  All of the tickets allocated to both clubs (Arsenal and Reading) were sold out to season ticket holders well in advance, so visitors like us are left trying to buy tickets online from third parties at crazy high prices.  Yes, its crazy to pay over $300 to go to a soccer match.  Yes, I paid it willingly!  We  did some research, so we think this is a reputable source of tickets but you have to put a certain amount of trust in strangers in order to get your tickets.\n\n\n\nAfter the train ride into Farringdon station we walk over to the apartment we had rented through AirBnB, another exercise in trusting strangers, and are rewarded with exactly the fantastic two bedroom apartment we were promised.  The owner met us at the door and showed us around.  He had purchased us some breakfast items, and some fruit, and a nice bottle of wine.  The apartment is on a Kings Mews street, which is nice and quiet so no problem with street noise either.  \n\n\n\nJim and Josh arrived a few minutes later with Jim's luggage.  We got a two bedroom so we could share with Jim and so he would not have to spend the entire long weekend in Josh's student housing.  Which after seeing it, I am glad we did!\n\n\n\nAs 11:00 came and went, we still had no tickets.  So we were preparing ourselves for the worst, which is really not too bad considering our apartment has a 56 inch big screen for the backup plan.  We were all a bit nervous, but found some good entertainment value in the chat that Josh had been having with customer support at the ticket agency.\n\n\n\n> Cust Serv (23:35:25): How can I help you?\n\n\n\n>Cust Serv (23:35:29): hi\n\n\n\n>JMS (23:35:45): Hi Tina, we spoke earlier today about my order #XXXXXX.

				"content_html": "<p>Somehow the midpoint of this journey escaped my notice.  Its not surprising as it has been a busy and amazing two weeks, full of new cultures and new experiences.    <!-- raw HTML omitted --> But, this morning we have time to just relax, watch the sea outside our room, and think about our experiences over the last three months.  In total we will be gone for 179 days!  That is a long time to be away from family and friends and the comforts of home.  But the time has gone by quickly, and will only accelerate as we head towards the end.</p>\n<p>I took a few minutes this morning to put together this map.  The red pins show everywhere we have been since January 1, 2015 and the green pins show all the places we have yet to visit before we arrive back home on June 28th.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>So, what do I take away from this journey so far?  I would like to break it up into three themes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The expanse of history</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The variety of culture</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The challenges of living away from home</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"history\">History</h3>\n<p>I never would have guessed that a new understanding and appreciation for world history would have been one of my biggest takeaways from this experience, but it is certainly shaping up to be that way.  A big reason for this has been  the history course at the University of Malta, and seeing the evidence of history everywhere you turn.  You go to Valletta and you can&rsquo;t escape seeing the walls and the buildings left behind by the Knights of St. John&rsquo;s.  You visit other places and see the Megalithic temples or evidence of the Romans or Phonecians or the  Ottoman Empire.  But what is really cool is that now when we leave Malta I have a much better appreciation for the timescale and the artifacts left behind by these same people in other parts of the Mediterranean.</p>\n<p>The scope of the Roman empire is simply amazing.  As we were standing among the Roman ruins in Volubilis Morocco, we could just as easily have been standing in Ostia Antica in Italy.  The frescos on the floor looked the same, the aqueducts and walls were identical to those we have seen in Italy, France, and Spain.  Now we flew, on a jet, and drove in a fast car to all of these places.  Its really hard to imagine how an empire like this managed when the way to travel was on horse, or foot, or camel.  There was no internet to get word back to headquarters so its easy to imagine that important information would be lost or take many months to get from place to place.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> In Malta, the arabic influence is clearly heard in the language, but not so much in the architecture.  However  now that we have traveled to Morocco and Spain it  is interesting to see the influences of the Ottoman empire in both places.  It is also interesting to see how all of the different empires recycled and reused materials from their predecessors.  Mosques built from the stones of Christian churches and vice versa.  Churches that still bear signs of a mosque built from stones taken from a prehistoric temple.  I am really excited to visit Istanbul in a few weeks to see this city where Islaam and Christianity have coexisted for so many centuries.</p>\n<p>I think that I have developed a better appreciation for the timescale of history.  When we hear that at one time Malta was predominantly Muslim, but now Christian, or that the Berbers of Morocco were predominantly Jewish but are now Muslim you wonder how did that happen?  Slowly.  These are changes that took place over hundreds of years.  Longer than the United States has been a country!  Back home we might say, look at this old building, it has been around since 1849.  That is barely a blip in the timescale of the history here in the Mediterranean.  At the same time, I have developed a new appreciation for the importance of preserving our own historical artifacts for future generations to study and learn from.</p>\n<h3 id=\"cultural-variety\">Cultural Variety</h3>\n<p>Living on internet time, it is easy to think that everything and everyone has always changed as fast as it does today.  But, it is easy to see that this is not true.  In the pueblos blancos of Spain, the towns of Malta, and the villages of Vietnam and Cambodia, things don&rsquo;t move so fast.  People still fix their old televisions and home appliances rather than just toss them aside after five years.  In the medinas of Morocco and the villages of the Mekong delta people still use every part of every animal and plant.  Husks of rice kernels are used to fire the kilns for making bricks, every part of the cow or goat or camel is used for something.</p>\n<p>I love to observe the old men in the different places that we visit.  They are the same everywhere! If I was a better photographer I would ask their permission so that I could take their pictures and share them.  On my walk to the University in Malta ther are three guys that sit on the sidewalk every morning, talking and arguing and solving the worlds problems.  In Spain we saw them in the small towns, having coffee when we would stop for our own mid-morning break from cycling.  Having a coffee, and talking, arguing, and solving the worlds problems. In Morocco they gather for their tea and they talk and they argue and they solve the worlds problems.  They supervise local construction projects everywhere. It is the same in Decorah as well: at the Back Home bakery, or the Oneota country club, or happy hour at Rubaiyat. In Decorah, I know the names of most of the men, and am slowly beginning to join their ranks.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Morocco was my first experience in traveling in a predominantly Muslim country.  Vietnam and Cambodia are predominantly Buddhist.  Malta is strongly Christian.  Of course there are big differences in all of these religions, but the main thing that strikes me is that the people who practice any of these religions have much more in common than you might think.  Of course, as our Moroccan guide noted, there are crazy Christians and crazy Muslims and crazy Jews who cause trouble, but the non-crazy people want to live good, healthy, peaceful lives.  People of all faiths love their children and their neighbors and want to make the world a better place.</p>\n<p>Talking about religion,  you can&rsquo;t ignore Football (soccer).  Soccer is another great unifier of people.  If you are a soccer fan, you can find a friend almost anywhere.  We have enjoyed watching the English Premier League in every country we have visited.  Of course in Spain it was a bit more of a challenge as La Liga dominates here.  But we have always been able to find a pub that carries the game.  People everywhere know Arsenal and Manchester United.  More importantly, they love to talk about their local team.   I love to ask the waiters or the porters  in the hotels if they are soccer fans and who they support.  They are always a bit surprised to find an American that is an avid futball fan.   Is soccer really growing in America? How did you become a fan?  What will happen with the MLS? Are you happy that Steven Gerrard is joining the LA Galaxy?  How many years will it be until the USA dominates in the world cup?</p>\n<h3 id=\"living-away-from-home\">Living away from home</h3>\n<p>When we left home in January Jane and I talked about how this would be a great experiment.  Would we be ready to be snowbirds?  Would we miss our friends too much to leave Decorah for six months?  What would it be like to make friends in a totally different culture?  It turns out that this was a flawed experiment.</p>\n<p>Although we have settled in to a flat in Malta its hard to compare this to what it would be like to have our own place in California or Arizona.  Although the flat is perfectly livable it is not ours, it is not even something that we would choose if given the chance to look around.  And, because we do not own the place and are only there for five months, we can&rsquo;t really change it.  No painting, no updating, so Nespresso coffee maker.  So we live with what we have, which is very different from how we would do things if it were our own.</p>\n<p>I am grateful for my own research work.  It has been nice to have some time to really sit back and think about the direction my research and work on <a href=\"http://runestoneinteractive.org\">Runestone Interactive</a> will need to take over the next few years.  I have learned that I am far from ready to retire or give up the exciting work that I do on this project and with students at Luther.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The people we have met in Malta are very nice, but we have not made new friends.  Building relationships takes time and investment, and it is hard for others to invest when our time in Malta is so short.  It is hard for us to invest when our time is short. It makes us think about being more welcoming and open to new friends back home.  It is easy to settle in to the same comfortable group of friends week after week.  It is much harder to break out and invite new people into the circle.  Mike and Shirley do a much better job of that than anyone!</p>\n<p>So, we have settled in to a routine that largely centers around the students and ourselves.  Occasionally  we have gone out with another couple, but this is fairly rare.  We have Skyped or Facetimed with our friends and family back home and have really enjoyed those times as much as anything.  Technology is a wonderful way to connect.  All of those Jetsons cartoons I watched where they  used the video phone have come true.  So, although we have always valued our friends, we have learned how important those friendships are on a much deeper level than we knew before.</p>\n<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Although we have traveled many thousands of miles, and logged many nights in hotels and restaurants, it is important to stop and realize that this journey has been an inward journey as well.  I am thankful for the growth and learning that this experience has brought so far, and I eagerly await the new experiences yet to come.  As we prepare to pack up and head to the airport this afternoon, I find that I cannot say we are going home.  Home will come soon, we will be home when we are back in Decorah and with friends and family on</p>\n<p>Bone Lake.</p>\n",

In total we will be gone for 179 days!  That is a long time to be away from family and friends and the comforts of home.  But the time has gone by quickly, and will only accelerate as we head towards the end.\n\n\n\nI took a few minutes this morning to put together this map.  The red pins show everywhere we have been since January 1, 2015 and the green pins show all the places we have yet to visit before we arrive back home on June 28th.\n\n\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=zDurv3BVrWLs.kUgsYjsWuIQA\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe>\n\n\n\nSo, what do I take away from this journey so far?  I would like to break it up into three themes:\n\n\n\n* The expanse of history\n\n* The variety of culture\n\n* The challenges of living away from home\n\n\n\n### History\n\n\n\nI never would have guessed that a new understanding and appreciation for world history would have been one of my biggest takeaways from this experience, but it is certainly shaping up to be that way.  A big reason for this has been  the history course at the University of Malta, and seeing the evidence of history everywhere you turn.  You go to Valletta and you can't escape seeing the walls and the buildings left behind by the Knights of St. John's.  You visit other places and see the Megalithic temples or evidence of the Romans or Phonecians or the  Ottoman Empire.  But what is really cool is that now when we leave Malta I have a much better appreciation for the timescale and the artifacts left behind by these same people in other parts of the Mediterranean. \n\n\n\nThe scope of the Roman empire is simply amazing.  As we were standing among the Roman ruins in Volubilis Morocco, we could just as easily have been standing in Ostia Antica in Italy.  The frescos on the floor looked the same, the aqueducts and walls were identical to those we have seen in Italy, France, and Spain.  Now we flew, on a jet, and drove in a fast car to all of these places.  Its really hard to imagine how an empire like this managed when the way to travel was on horse, or foot, or camel.  There was no internet to get word back to headquarters so its easy to imagine that important information would be lost or take many months to get from place to place.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9274f219ff.jpg\" width=\"200\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px;\"> In Malta, the arabic influence is clearly heard in the language, but not so much in the architecture.  However  now that we have traveled to Morocco and Spain it  is interesting to see the influences of the Ottoman empire in both places.  It is also interesting to see how all of the different empires recycled and reused materials from their predecessors.  Mosques built from the stones of Christian churches and vice versa.  Churches that still bear signs of a mosque built from stones taken from a prehistoric temple.  I am really excited to visit Istanbul in a few weeks to see this city where Islaam and Christianity have coexisted for so many centuries.\n\n\n\nI think that I have developed a better appreciation for the timescale of history.  When we hear that at one time Malta was predominantly Muslim, but now Christian, or that the Berbers of Morocco were predominantly Jewish but are now Muslim you wonder how did that happen?  Slowly.  These are changes that took place over hundreds of years.  Longer than the United States has been a country!  Back home we might say, look at this old building, it has been around since 1849.  That is barely a blip in the timescale of the history here in the Mediterranean.  At the same time, I have developed a new appreciation for the importance of preserving our own historical artifacts for future generations to study and learn from.\n\n\n\n### Cultural Variety\n\n\n\nLiving on internet time, it is easy to think that everything and everyone has always changed as fast as it does today.  But, it is easy to see that this is not true.  In the pueblos blancos of Spain, the towns of Malta, and the villages of Vietnam and Cambodia, things don't move so fast.  People still fix their old televisions and home appliances rather than just toss them aside after five years.  In the medinas of Morocco and the villages of the Mekong delta people still use every part of every animal and plant.  Husks of rice kernels are used to fire the kilns for making bricks, every part of the cow or goat or camel is used for something.\n\n\n\nI love to observe the old men in the different places that we visit.  They are the same everywhere! If I was a better photographer I would ask their permission so that I could take their pictures and share them.  On my walk to the University in Malta ther are three guys that sit on the sidewalk every morning, talking and arguing and solving the worlds problems.  In Spain we saw them in the small towns, having coffee when we would stop for our own mid-morning break from cycling.  Having a coffee, and talking, arguing, and solving the worlds problems. In Morocco they gather for their tea and they talk and they argue and they solve the worlds problems.  They supervise local construction projects everywhere. It is the same in Decorah as well: at the Back Home bakery, or the Oneota country club, or happy hour at Rubaiyat. In Decorah, I know the names of most of the men, and am slowly beginning to join their ranks.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6b3f5c415f.jpg\" width=\"200\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px;\"> Morocco was my first experience in traveling in a predominantly Muslim country.  Vietnam and Cambodia are predominantly Buddhist.  Malta is strongly Christian.  Of course there are big differences in all of these religions, but the main thing that strikes me is that the people who practice any of these religions have much more in common than you might think.  Of course, as our Moroccan guide noted, there are crazy Christians and crazy Muslims and crazy Jews who cause trouble, but the non-crazy people want to live good, healthy, peaceful lives.  People of all faiths love their children and their neighbors and want to make the world a better place.\n\n\n\nTalking about religion,  you can't ignore Football (soccer).  Soccer is another great unifier of people.  If you are a soccer fan, you can find a friend almost anywhere.  We have enjoyed watching the English Premier League in every country we have visited.  Of course in Spain it was a bit more of a challenge as La Liga dominates here.  But we have always been able to find a pub that carries the game.  People everywhere know Arsenal and Manchester United.  More importantly, they love to talk about their local team.   I love to ask the waiters or the porters  in the hotels if they are soccer fans and who they support.  They are always a bit surprised to find an American that is an avid futball fan.   Is soccer really growing in America? How did you become a fan?  What will happen with the MLS? Are you happy that Steven Gerrard is joining the LA Galaxy?  How many years will it be until the USA dominates in the world cup?  \n\n\n\n### Living away from home\n\n\n\nWhen we left home in January Jane and I talked about how this would be a great experiment.  Would we be ready to be snowbirds?  Would we miss our friends too much to leave Decorah for six months?  What would it be like to make friends in a totally different culture?  It turns out that this was a flawed experiment.\n\n\n\nAlthough we have settled in to a flat in Malta its hard to compare this to what it would be like to have our own place in California or Arizona.  Although the flat is perfectly livable it is not ours, it is not even something that we would choose if given the chance to look around.  And, because we do not own the place and are only there for five months, we can't really change it.  No painting, no updating, so Nespresso coffee maker.  So we live with what we have, which is very different from how we would do things if it were our own.\n\n\n\nI am grateful for my own research work.  It has been nice to have some time to really sit back and think about the direction my research and work on [Runestone Interactive](http://runestoneinteractive.org) will need to take over the next few years.  I have learned that I am far from ready to retire or give up the exciting work that I do on this project and with students at Luther.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/04838ee4a6.jpg\" width=\"200\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 10px;\"> The people we have met in Malta are very nice, but we have not made new friends.  Building relationships takes time and investment, and it is hard for others to invest when our time in Malta is so short.  It is hard for us to invest when our time is short. It makes us think about being more welcoming and open to new friends back home.  It is easy to settle in to the same comfortable group of friends week after week.  It is much harder to break out and invite new people into the circle.  Mike and Shirley do a much better job of that than anyone!\n\n\n\nSo, we have settled in to a routine that largely centers around the students and ourselves.  Occasionally  we have gone out with another couple, but this is fairly rare.  We have Skyped or Facetimed with our friends and family back home and have really enjoyed those times as much as anything.  Technology is a wonderful way to connect.  All of those Jetsons cartoons I watched where they  used the video phone have come true.  So, although we have always valued our friends, we have learned how important those friendships are on a much deeper level than we knew before.\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7e4cee554e.jpg\" width=\"200\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px;\"> Although we have traveled many thousands of miles, and logged many nights in hotels and restaurants, it is important to stop and realize that this journey has been an inward journey as well.  I am thankful for the growth and learning that this experience has brought so far, and I eagerly await the new experiences yet to come.  As we prepare to pack up and head to the airport this afternoon, I find that I cannot say we are going home.  Home will come soon, we will be home when we are back in Decorah and with friends and family on\n\n Bone Lake.\n",

I&rsquo;ll be back later.</p>\n<p>We shook hands laughing and parted ways. Such is the life in the\nMarrakech markets. For the record, I&rsquo;m just kidding Angel, Jenna,\nMeredith, Meredith, Tricia, Rachel, Erika, Olivia, Katie and Emma! I\nwould hold out for at least thirty camels a piece.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/add42e55b5.jpg\" alt=\"The women are worth 200 camels, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll do with theguys.\"></p>\n<p>Joking aside, traveling with 10 &ldquo;daughters.&rdquo; did present a few\nchallenges. Before we left, we had discussed with the students that\nMorocco has not come as far in the area of Women&rsquo;s rights as the United\nStates and many other european countries. This was hammered home for us\nas we drove into Marrakech and our guide told us breathlessly that in\nMarrakech we would see something new and very different... (long pause)\nWomen on motor scooters!</p>\n<p>Before we left we told our &ldquo;daughters&rdquo; that it was important to adopt\na more conservative style of dress for this trip. Cover your shoulders,\nno tank-tops and no short-shorts we said. And they all followed this,\nalthough next time I would explicitly add running tights to my list of\nitems to not wear. We heard a few mutters from our students as we saw\nfemale tourists from other countries in revealing outfits. Nevertheless,\nour daughters stuck out, the long blond hair, and blue eyes (and,\nunfortunately, the running tights) were a real attraction for many of\nthe local young men.</p>\n<p>We learned that sixteen year old boys are idiots no matter where you are\nin the world. One night a group of boys followed five of the daughters\nback from a restaurant. Although they said they were not in danger, it\nwas definitely an uncomfortable situation for them to be ogled and\nfollowed down the narrow dark streets of the medina by this small group.\nOther times we all heard the whistles or moans and comments from men of\nall ages as the group walked by. When you walked in the back of the\ngroup it was painfully obvious to watch the heads turn and stare as the\ngroup went by. I&rsquo;m hoping that some of them will write about this from\ntheir own perspective in their journals or blogs and that we can have\nfurther conversation about this back in Malta.</p>\n<p>Today is our last day of traveling with the students for the Malta\nEaster break. Tomorrow we go our separate directions. The students to\nAmsterdam, Belgium, Germany, England, Greece and the Czek Republic.

				"content_text": "\n# Lost in the Souks\n\nAs I dropped Jane and Tricia off at the spa for their pedicure the young\nman at the door said with a grin, \"I'll give you 20 camels for your\ndaughter!\" Oh crap, I thought, not another session of haggling!\n\nNot my daughter I said.\n\nOh, no problem, then 20 camels for her **and** 20 camels for you.\n\nGreat, I have nine more like her! I'll be back later.\n\nWe shook hands laughing and parted ways. Such is the life in the\nMarrakech markets. For the record, I'm just kidding Angel, Jenna,\nMeredith, Meredith, Tricia, Rachel, Erika, Olivia, Katie and Emma! I\nwould hold out for at least thirty camels a piece.\n\n![The women are worth 200 camels, I don't know what I'll do with the\nguys.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/add42e55b5.jpg)\n\nJoking aside, traveling with 10 \"daughters.\" did present a few\nchallenges. Before we left, we had discussed with the students that\nMorocco has not come as far in the area of Women's rights as the United\nStates and many other european countries. This was hammered home for us\nas we drove into Marrakech and our guide told us breathlessly that in\nMarrakech we would see something new and very different\\... (long pause)\nWomen on motor scooters!\n\nBefore we left we told our \"daughters\" that it was important to adopt\na more conservative style of dress for this trip. Cover your shoulders,\nno tank-tops and no short-shorts we said. And they all followed this,\nalthough next time I would explicitly add running tights to my list of\nitems to not wear. We heard a few mutters from our students as we saw\nfemale tourists from other countries in revealing outfits. Nevertheless,\nour daughters stuck out, the long blond hair, and blue eyes (and,\nunfortunately, the running tights) were a real attraction for many of\nthe local young men.\n\nWe learned that sixteen year old boys are idiots no matter where you are\nin the world. One night a group of boys followed five of the daughters\nback from a restaurant. Although they said they were not in danger, it\nwas definitely an uncomfortable situation for them to be ogled and\nfollowed down the narrow dark streets of the medina by this small group.\nOther times we all heard the whistles or moans and comments from men of\nall ages as the group walked by. When you walked in the back of the\ngroup it was painfully obvious to watch the heads turn and stare as the\ngroup went by. I'm hoping that some of them will write about this from\ntheir own perspective in their journals or blogs and that we can have\nfurther conversation about this back in Malta.\n\nToday is our last day of traveling with the students for the Malta\nEaster break. Tomorrow we go our separate directions. The students to\nAmsterdam, Belgium, Germany, England, Greece and the Czek Republic. Jane\nand I to southern Spain.\n\nIt has been an amazing trip, Morocco is surprisingly beautiful at every\nturn. We have learned a lot about this country, its history, its culture\nand its people.

What if I don't want\n    this? Its ok, we will still be friends.

In the\nend, Ethan, Ben, and I were the brave one's and we gave our best\nrendition of the college hymn, \"To Luther.\" A bit later the\nappropriate beat inspired a rousing rendition of \"We Will Rock You\"\nwith Ben taking the lead and showing a part of himself that I hadn't\nseen yet.\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/d703689775.jpg){width=\"200px\"}\n\nThis morning, when I got to the top of the dune to watch the sun rise, I\nfound a water bottle left over from a previous group. The wind had blown\nthe sand over and around the bottle leaving a very interesting pattern\non the leeward side. A miniature example of the sand dunes and the\ndesert as a whole. I don't know what the last two days will mean for\nthe students in the long run. I don't even know how today's experience\nwill shape my own future. But I know it will, as each past travel\nadventure has left its mark. It strikes me that the bottle and the dunes\nare a great metaphor for study abroad and Lutheran higher education. We\ncan lecture for hours, and give them days of homework, but it is these\nexperiences that will shape our students in ways we cannot possibly\nimagine or plan.\n\n![](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c5a1bb7ac3.jpg)\n",

				"title": "Go Go Gozo",
				"content_html": "<h1 id=\"go-go-gozo\">Go Go Gozo</h1>\n<p>The first thing you notice when you get to the Cirkewwa ferry terminal\nis how close you are to Comino and Gozo. All this talk of using EU funds\nto build a bride, doesn&rsquo;t seem that far fetched. One hop to Comino,\nanother to Gozo. Nevertheless the short ferry ride gives you time to\nanticipate the day ahead. After weeks of cool and rain we had a\nfantastic weather day to visit the island.</p>\n<p>I was trying out the <em>GeoTag Photos</em> app for the trip, that would use\nthe gps in my iPhone to track our movement around the island. Later you\nupload the gps data and sync it with your photos. Since my camera\ndoesn&rsquo;t have a built in GPS, this works well for adding location data\nto your photos. It worked great, and you can even use the data you\ncapture to build a map of your day.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2b2d9825a0.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<p>We hired a van and a guide for this day because we wanted to cover a lot\nof ground. You can get everywhere on public buses but you end up\nspending half your day waiting around bus stops. It is also a law on\nMalta that at many of the outdoor attractions groups of 10 or more must\nbe accompanied by a licensed guide. So, our guide, Joseph, met us at the\nferry terminal on Gozo and we were off on our whirlwind tour. Now you\nmay think that this was quite a marathon day but you have to know that\nGozo is only 8.7 miles long and 4.5 miles wide.</p>\n<p>Our first stop was Ramla bay, a red-sand beach and lots of green space.\nYes, glorious, fabulous, wide open space free from limestone buildings\nand paved roads. Over the course of the day it became very clear to me\nthat this is exactly what I have been missing, and I&rsquo;m really coming to\nunderstand that although there are things I like about the city I am\nreally a small town guy at heart.</p>\n<p>After some time of watching the students cavorting on the beach we moved\non to Calypso cave, where we had a great view of the underwater sea wall\nbuilt by the Knights of St. John as part of the islands protection\nagainst the Turks. You can see the wall, closer to shore than you might\nthink pretty clearly in the picture.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/dabce188fb.jpg\" alt=\"A great day out of the city! Enjoying the green and some niceweather.\"></p>\n<p>From the bay we headed to the Megalithic temples at Ä gantija that date\nto Neolithic times. We had heard a lot about these temples in our\nHistory lecture and so it was great to visit and see these massive\nstructures first hand. They truly are massive. There are some hints\nabout how the giant slabs were moved around, in that they have hundreds\nof stone balls that have been discovered. The theory is that the balls\nwere used like bearings and the slabs were rolled on top of the balls.\nPretty clever for 5000BC if you ask me.</p>\n<p>From the temples we made short stop at the salt flats in Marsalforn. It\nwas only a five minute stop but is definitely on the list to return to.\nI managed to purchase a bag of sea salt from the guy who owns the salt\nflats, and so I should be set with some great salt for cooking the rest\nof our time here in Malta.</p>\n<p>Next was a stop in Victoria for a quick slice of pizza as we walked to\nthe Citadel. Today was really about great outdoor scenery, but I include\none shot of the citadel. Bonus points to anyone who can spot the problem\nin this photo.</p>\n<p>The highlight of the day was the Azure Window. This is nearly iconic\nplace for Malta, and it certainly lives up to all expectations. What I\nwasn&rsquo;t expecting was the awesome little boat ride from the inland sea\nto the Azure Window. You start out in this little bit of inland water,\nand the boat takes you through a tunnel out into the mediterranean sea,\ninto a few caves and finally under the big arch that forms the window.\nIt was so beautiful and I can&rsquo;t wait to get back to Gozo again to visit\nthis place.

				"content_text": "\n# Go Go Gozo\n\nThe first thing you notice when you get to the Cirkewwa ferry terminal\nis how close you are to Comino and Gozo. All this talk of using EU funds\nto build a bride, doesn't seem that far fetched. One hop to Comino,\nanother to Gozo. Nevertheless the short ferry ride gives you time to\nanticipate the day ahead. After weeks of cool and rain we had a\nfantastic weather day to visit the island.\n\nI was trying out the *GeoTag Photos* app for the trip, that would use\nthe gps in my iPhone to track our movement around the island. Later you\nupload the gps data and sync it with your photos. Since my camera\ndoesn't have a built in GPS, this works well for adding location data\nto your photos. It worked great, and you can even use the data you\ncapture to build a map of your day.\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2b2d9825a0.jpg)\n\nWe hired a van and a guide for this day because we wanted to cover a lot\nof ground. You can get everywhere on public buses but you end up\nspending half your day waiting around bus stops. It is also a law on\nMalta that at many of the outdoor attractions groups of 10 or more must\nbe accompanied by a licensed guide. So, our guide, Joseph, met us at the\nferry terminal on Gozo and we were off on our whirlwind tour. Now you\nmay think that this was quite a marathon day but you have to know that\nGozo is only 8.7 miles long and 4.5 miles wide.\n\nOur first stop was Ramla bay, a red-sand beach and lots of green space.\nYes, glorious, fabulous, wide open space free from limestone buildings\nand paved roads. Over the course of the day it became very clear to me\nthat this is exactly what I have been missing, and I'm really coming to\nunderstand that although there are things I like about the city I am\nreally a small town guy at heart.\n\nAfter some time of watching the students cavorting on the beach we moved\non to Calypso cave, where we had a great view of the underwater sea wall\nbuilt by the Knights of St. John as part of the islands protection\nagainst the Turks. You can see the wall, closer to shore than you might\nthink pretty clearly in the picture.\n\n![A great day out of the city! Enjoying the green and some nice\nweather.](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/dabce188fb.jpg)\n\nFrom the bay we headed to the Megalithic temples at Ä gantija that date\nto Neolithic times. We had heard a lot about these temples in our\nHistory lecture and so it was great to visit and see these massive\nstructures first hand. They truly are massive. There are some hints\nabout how the giant slabs were moved around, in that they have hundreds\nof stone balls that have been discovered. The theory is that the balls\nwere used like bearings and the slabs were rolled on top of the balls.\nPretty clever for 5000BC if you ask me.\n\nFrom the temples we made short stop at the salt flats in Marsalforn. It\nwas only a five minute stop but is definitely on the list to return to.\nI managed to purchase a bag of sea salt from the guy who owns the salt\nflats, and so I should be set with some great salt for cooking the rest\nof our time here in Malta.\n\nNext was a stop in Victoria for a quick slice of pizza as we walked to\nthe Citadel. Today was really about great outdoor scenery, but I include\none shot of the citadel. Bonus points to anyone who can spot the problem\nin this photo.\n\nThe highlight of the day was the Azure Window. This is nearly iconic\nplace for Malta, and it certainly lives up to all expectations. What I\nwasn't expecting was the awesome little boat ride from the inland sea\nto the Azure Window. You start out in this little bit of inland water,\nand the boat takes you through a tunnel out into the mediterranean sea,\ninto a few caves and finally under the big arch that forms the window.\nIt was so beautiful and I can't wait to get back to Gozo again to visit\nthis place. You could easily spend half a day hiking around and on top\nof the arch.\n\nOur final stop, and another highlight is the town of Xlendi (pronounced\nshlendee). The first thing I said to our guide was that I felt like I\nhad just driven into Cinque Terre, and he agreed. This is a beautiful\nblue bay, with lots of space for hiking and enjoying the outdoors.\n\nAlthough there were a lot of places that needed more time, the trip was\na real success in that we got a great taste of all the places we want to\nrevisit.\n",

				"content_html": "<h1 id=\"adventures-of-an-expat-cord-cutter\">Adventures of an Expat Cord Cutter</h1>\n<p>Even thought I&rsquo;m living abroad and traveling for an extended period\nthere are a few entertaining parts of my life I&rsquo;m not willing to leave\nbehind. Watching Arsenal, keeping up with The Big Bang Theory, The\nBlacklist, Food Network, and a few others. How you do this is well\ncovered territory. You can probably figure it out with several google\nsearches, but it seems worth it to collect my own efforts into one\ncohesive post. Here are the problems to solve:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How to stream TV shows that have geographic restrictions. Lots of\ncontent is available only inside the borders of the USA.</li>\n<li>How to get the content off of your small screen and onto a larger\nscreen if you are lucky enough to have one.</li>\n<li>How to optimize your WiFi and streaming throughput in the midst of\nan urban WiFi jungle.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Warning. This is a geeky technical post. You can quit here and I won&rsquo;t\nfeel bad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"streaming\">Streaming</h2>\n<p>There are lots of options for streaming from places like Hulu, Netflix,\nand even the big four major networks all have apps now that let you\nstream more or less of their content. When we left home, I had\nNBCSportsLive Extra, Netflix, HBO Go, DirectTV all installed on my iPad.\nI also have iTunes, and had downloaded a few movies that I had on my\nlist to watch. In the United States this would be fine, but all of these\napps (except iTunes) have geographic restrictions on them. So I also had\nto subscribe to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service and configure\nthat on my iPad.</p>\n<h3 id=\"vpn\">VPN</h3>\n<p>If you are not familiar with a VPN you can think of it as a bit of\nsoftware that messes around with your network configuration to make the\nrest of your computer and the rest of the world think that you are a\npart of some other network. This is often used in large organizations\nwhere you have content that you restrict to your own institutional\nnetwork. Luther does this with some resources, like our network drives.\nOther services, such as O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Safari, may check to make sure that\nyou are coming from a particular network before you are granted access\nto their own content because of a corporate licensing agreement. If you\nhave a VPN connection back to your institutional network then it is just\nlike you are in the office and not at home or halfway around the world.</p>\n<p>Now the reason this is important for my entertainment is that there are\nmany VPN services that exist partly for the purpose of making it look\nlike you are connected to a network in the United States somewhere\nrather than a network in Vietnam or Malta. I signed up with <a href=\"http://www.privteinternetaccess.com\">Private\nInternet Access</a> These services\nalso have the side effect that your content is encrypted from the time\nit leaves your computer until it leaves the VPN provider, which many\npeople look at as a significant privacy benefit. Using a VPN to trick\nNBC into thinking that I am in the united states might be considered a\nmoral gray area, but I&rsquo;m still paying my DirecTV, and Mediacom bill\nevery month back home every month so I don&rsquo;t have any problem going to\nsleep.</p>\n<p>The VPN solution works pretty well, except for some content providers\nhave figured out how to identify these VPN servers, and have made moves\nto block the connections from known VPN providers. I&rsquo;m looking at you\nABC.</p>\n<p>This content blocking thing is interesting, especially from companies\nlike ABC that force you to watch commercials as part of their streamed\noffering. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they want more eyeballs on their commercials?</p>\n<h2 id=\"to-the-big-screen\">To the Big Screen</h2>\n<p>Once we got settled in our flat in Malta, I decided I wanted to upgrade\nthe streaming experience by adding an AppleTV to the TV in our flat.\nWith this setup, I can use Airplay to send the content from my iPad to\nthe larger screen we had set up in our living area. Except that it\ndoesn&rsquo;t work. The AppleTV has no provision for joining a VPN. There are\nsome ugly hacks that involve jailbreaking your AppleTV but I didn&rsquo;t\nwant to go there. I&rsquo;d rather install more iPad apps for streaming\nFoodTV, Fox Sports, and several others that I&rsquo;ve added to the list\nsince we arrived.</p>\n<p>Here is our Entertainment center in our flat in Sliema.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/50f5b94cb6.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"dns\">DNS</h3>\n<p>The Domain Name Service is at the heart of the Internet. If you haven&rsquo;t\nbeen subjected to my days of DNS in Networking class, you can think of\nit like a phone book for the entire world. Of course its way more fun\nand complicated than that.</p>\n<p>So what does DNS have to do with this particular problem? Well, when you\nwant to contact a website or stream some video, you need to look up the\naddress of the server that authenticates you, <strong>and</strong> checks to see that\nthat address is in the right country. You find the address by contacting\nyour friendly local DNS server. You normally don&rsquo;t have to worry about\nthis because your home router takes care of it. But, it is an easy thing\nto customize. It turns out that these video streaming services use one\nserver for authentication, and a different server for video streaming.</p>\n<p>With me so far? Now there are companies that provide DNS services to\nreplace the DNS provided by your friendly neighborhood Internet Service\nProvider. For example Google runs DNS servers that you can use. They are\nreally reliable, and of course keep track of all the addresses you look\nup to better inform their search algorithms I suppose.

This little setup is actually called a\n<strong>proxy.</strong> So when you ask for the address of the ABC authentication\nserver you don&rsquo;t connect to ABC you connect to one of the servers run\nby <a href=\"http://www.unotelly.com\">UnoTelly</a>. UnoTelly sits between you and\nthe authentication server and passes on your information. But since the\nUnoTelly server is in the United State, ABC thinks you are in the United\nStates too. With the authentication taken care of UnoTelly gets out of\nthe way and allows your AppleTV to connect directly to the streaming\nserver. So far the UnoTelly servers remain blissfully below the radar of\ncontent providers everywhere. Yay technology. Also, DNS is very easy to\ncustomize even on your AppleTV.</p>\n<p>This is a silly arms race between the VPN Providers, the DNS providers,\nand the content providers.

In the meantime its likely that every time\nthe content providers find one way to block some clever software\nengineer will figure out a way around the block. It reminds of of disk\ncopy protection software in my younger days.

How to optimize your streaming in\nthe WiFi jungle. The flat we live in is in a very densely populated\narea. My WiFi Scanner program shows between 15 and 20 different access\npoints depending on the time of day and day of the week. With this many\naccess points there is a lot of interference because everyone is trying\nto use a rather narrow band of the radio spectrum at the same time.\nAlthough WiFi is divided up into 11 different channels, there are really\nonly 3 of the channels that don&rsquo;t overlap and interfere with nearby\nchannels.</p>\n<p>So the best solution is actually to use wired internet if you can.\nluckily my AppleTV and my Router sit right next to each other, so its\neasy to plug in.

But that will actually make the\nproblem worse, because 1 and 2 will be unaware of each other and just\nmake interference. The counter intuitive solution is to pick the same\nchannel as your neighbor with the strongest signal.

				"content_text": "\n# Adventures of an Expat Cord Cutter\n\nEven thought I'm living abroad and traveling for an extended period\nthere are a few entertaining parts of my life I'm not willing to leave\nbehind. Watching Arsenal, keeping up with The Big Bang Theory, The\nBlacklist, Food Network, and a few others. How you do this is well\ncovered territory. You can probably figure it out with several google\nsearches, but it seems worth it to collect my own efforts into one\ncohesive post. Here are the problems to solve:\n\n1.  How to stream TV shows that have geographic restrictions. Lots of\n    content is available only inside the borders of the USA.\n2.  How to get the content off of your small screen and onto a larger\n    screen if you are lucky enough to have one.\n3.  How to optimize your WiFi and streaming throughput in the midst of\n    an urban WiFi jungle.\n\nWarning. This is a geeky technical post. You can quit here and I won't\nfeel bad.\n\n## Streaming\n\nThere are lots of options for streaming from places like Hulu, Netflix,\nand even the big four major networks all have apps now that let you\nstream more or less of their content. When we left home, I had\nNBCSportsLive Extra, Netflix, HBO Go, DirectTV all installed on my iPad.\nI also have iTunes, and had downloaded a few movies that I had on my\nlist to watch. In the United States this would be fine, but all of these\napps (except iTunes) have geographic restrictions on them. So I also had\nto subscribe to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service and configure\nthat on my iPad.\n\n### VPN\n\nIf you are not familiar with a VPN you can think of it as a bit of\nsoftware that messes around with your network configuration to make the\nrest of your computer and the rest of the world think that you are a\npart of some other network. This is often used in large organizations\nwhere you have content that you restrict to your own institutional\nnetwork. Luther does this with some resources, like our network drives.\nOther services, such as O'Reilly's Safari, may check to make sure that\nyou are coming from a particular network before you are granted access\nto their own content because of a corporate licensing agreement. If you\nhave a VPN connection back to your institutional network then it is just\nlike you are in the office and not at home or halfway around the world.\n\nNow the reason this is important for my entertainment is that there are\nmany VPN services that exist partly for the purpose of making it look\nlike you are connected to a network in the United States somewhere\nrather than a network in Vietnam or Malta. I signed up with [Private\nInternet Access](http://www.privteinternetaccess.com) These services\nalso have the side effect that your content is encrypted from the time\nit leaves your computer until it leaves the VPN provider, which many\npeople look at as a significant privacy benefit. Using a VPN to trick\nNBC into thinking that I am in the united states might be considered a\nmoral gray area, but I'm still paying my DirecTV, and Mediacom bill\nevery month back home every month so I don't have any problem going to\nsleep.\n\nThe VPN solution works pretty well, except for some content providers\nhave figured out how to identify these VPN servers, and have made moves\nto block the connections from known VPN providers. I'm looking at you\nABC.\n\nThis content blocking thing is interesting, especially from companies\nlike ABC that force you to watch commercials as part of their streamed\noffering. Why wouldn't they want more eyeballs on their commercials?\n\n## To the Big Screen\n\nOnce we got settled in our flat in Malta, I decided I wanted to upgrade\nthe streaming experience by adding an AppleTV to the TV in our flat.\nWith this setup, I can use Airplay to send the content from my iPad to\nthe larger screen we had set up in our living area. Except that it\ndoesn't work. The AppleTV has no provision for joining a VPN. There are\nsome ugly hacks that involve jailbreaking your AppleTV but I didn't\nwant to go there. I'd rather install more iPad apps for streaming\nFoodTV, Fox Sports, and several others that I've added to the list\nsince we arrived.\n\nHere is our Entertainment center in our flat in Sliema.\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/50f5b94cb6.jpg)\n\n### DNS\n\nThe Domain Name Service is at the heart of the Internet. If you haven't\nbeen subjected to my days of DNS in Networking class, you can think of\nit like a phone book for the entire world. Of course its way more fun\nand complicated than that.\n\nSo what does DNS have to do with this particular problem? Well, when you\nwant to contact a website or stream some video, you need to look up the\naddress of the server that authenticates you, **and** checks to see that\nthat address is in the right country. You find the address by contacting\nyour friendly local DNS server. You normally don't have to worry about\nthis because your home router takes care of it. But, it is an easy thing\nto customize. It turns out that these video streaming services use one\nserver for authentication, and a different server for video streaming.\n\nWith me so far? Now there are companies that provide DNS services to\nreplace the DNS provided by your friendly neighborhood Internet Service\nProvider. For example Google runs DNS servers that you can use. They are\nreally reliable, and of course keep track of all the addresses you look\nup to better inform their search algorithms I suppose. However, if\ngoogle wasn't trustworthy, you could ask them for the address of\ncompany X, and they could lie to you so you connected to company Y.\n\nIn order to avoid a full VPN, and to make it easier for helping iPads,\niPhones, and AppleTVs get around the geographical restrictions there are\nsome companies that are running their own DNS servers that will in fact\nlie to you about the server you connect to for the authentication part\nof setting up a video stream. This little setup is actually called a\n**proxy.** So when you ask for the address of the ABC authentication\nserver you don't connect to ABC you connect to one of the servers run\nby [UnoTelly](http://www.unotelly.com). UnoTelly sits between you and\nthe authentication server and passes on your information. But since the\nUnoTelly server is in the United State, ABC thinks you are in the United\nStates too. With the authentication taken care of UnoTelly gets out of\nthe way and allows your AppleTV to connect directly to the streaming\nserver. So far the UnoTelly servers remain blissfully below the radar of\ncontent providers everywhere. Yay technology. Also, DNS is very easy to\ncustomize even on your AppleTV.\n\nThis is a silly arms race between the VPN Providers, the DNS providers,\nand the content providers.

We have no bike. We have no scooter. So we walk, and\nwalk, and walk. When we arrive at our building we climb 3 flights of\nstairs to get to our flat. Walking is good, but with all the hills my\nshins really suffered the first couple of days. They are getting better\nnow. We are also learning the bus system for the longer trips. But\nreally the island is not that big and we can walk almost anywhere to get\nwhat we need. We are told that the Maltese would be appalled, as they\nwill drive their cars two blocks to the store rather than walk.</p>\n<p>They have people to clean the streets and sidewalks regularly, but its\namazing what litterbugs people are around here. And many people let\ntheir dogs poop on the sidewalk!! They just leave it there for the\nsidewalk cleaner to pick up later. Watch your step as you are walking.\nYou have to be alert to many things while you are walking. First the\nsidewalks in most places are so narrow that you can&rsquo;t really walk side\nby side. If you meet someone, chances are one of you is going to step\nout into the street. You just better hope one of the drivers doesn&rsquo;t\nchoose that moment to get the carbon out of their car and come roaring\naround a corner at you. Most of the streets are one way, and are only\nwide enough for one lane of traffic. I&rsquo;ve talked to several people now\nabout getting a bike and they have all strongly advised me against it!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/58d80035e0.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-people\">The People</h2>\n<p>We have been very fortunate to be welcomed to the island by some Luther\nalumni, both Maltese and American expats. This has been really nice. We\nhaven&rsquo;t really met many people in the neighborhood yet, but we have only\nbeen here a few days, so we surely look like we are just short term\nvisitors to most people. The owner of the Ironmongery (a hardware store)\nwas super nice to me today when I stopped by to purchase a gas grill for\nthe roof. The people at the University have been very welcoming, and we\nhave a long list of helpful advice and things to check out.

If you need electronics you go to the\nelectronics store. If you need wine, you can go, well, almost anywhere.\nSeriously, there are all kinds of little wine shops on every street.

				"content_html": "<h1 id=\"sixty-minutes-of-inspiration\">Sixty Minutes of Inspiration</h1>\n<p>Today was another one of those days that was thought-provoking,\nuplifting, and inspiring. This morning we had a new guide, who took us\nto his own village and showed us his own house. That experience will be\na part of a post that has been brewing for a week or so. I&rsquo;m going to\ndo this one first as it is fresh in my mind.</p>\n<p>We just got back from JWOC (yes, they pronounce it jay walk) which\nstands for <a href=\"http://www.journeyswithinourcommunity.org/about/\">Journeys Within Our\nCommunity</a>. What a\ngreat experience! We didn&rsquo;t really know a lot about what we were in for\nthis afternoon, other than we were there to volunteer in a class, and it\nwould involve speaking english. So far, so good.</p>\n<p>Before I tell you about the class, and what we did, I want to give you a\nlittle background about JWOC and the educational system here in\nCambodia. The latter is easy. Its pretty minimal. Students <em>may</em> go to\nschool from ages six to fourteen. After that there is really not much\nfor them. Students may go to a private school for further education, but\nthey are pretty expensive for most people in Cambodia.</p>\n<p>JWOC has programs in five key areas: Community Assistance, Clean Water,\nMicrofinance, Free Classes, and Scholarships.

				"content_text": "\n# Sixty Minutes of Inspiration\n\nToday was another one of those days that was thought-provoking,\nuplifting, and inspiring. This morning we had a new guide, who took us\nto his own village and showed us his own house. That experience will be\na part of a post that has been brewing for a week or so. I'm going to\ndo this one first as it is fresh in my mind.\n\nWe just got back from JWOC (yes, they pronounce it jay walk) which\nstands for [Journeys Within Our\nCommunity](http://www.journeyswithinourcommunity.org/about/). What a\ngreat experience! We didn't really know a lot about what we were in for\nthis afternoon, other than we were there to volunteer in a class, and it\nwould involve speaking english. So far, so good.\n\nBefore I tell you about the class, and what we did, I want to give you a\nlittle background about JWOC and the educational system here in\nCambodia. The latter is easy. Its pretty minimal. Students *may* go to\nschool from ages six to fourteen. After that there is really not much\nfor them. Students may go to a private school for further education, but\nthey are pretty expensive for most people in Cambodia.\n\nJWOC has programs in five key areas: Community Assistance, Clean Water,\nMicrofinance, Free Classes, and Scholarships. The scholarship program is\nthe heart of it all. Since 2005 JWOC has provided 120 scholarships for\nstudents to get a university education.

				"content_html": "<h1 id=\"lifestyle-reflections\">Lifestyle Reflections</h1>\n<p>Note: I wrote the first part of this post as a draft, while in Cambodia,\nand then forgot to &ldquo;un-draft&rdquo; it. So I just realized four months later\nthat it has not been finished or published. I will finish and publish it\nnow.</p>\n<p>Some of my earliest memories are of a small house in a small town in\nSouthwestern Minnesota in the late 1960&rsquo;s. My Grandma Sundahl lived in\nthis house. As you came in the side door, you could turn left and go up\na few stairs to the kitchen, or straight down the stairs to the\nbasement. The basement had three rooms, a laundry room off to the left\nas you went down the stairs. I remember big crockery bowls on the\ncounter in that room and a big black adding machine that we could play\nwith endlessly. To the right was a cinder block room with a cement\nfloor. Grandma had painted the walls and decorated them with big posters\nof the Campbell Soup kids. There was a ping pong table at one end. As\nfar as I can remebmer the other end of that room was open for us to run\naround in. Straight ahead as you reached the bottom of the stairs was\nthe big dark scary room. there was a shower in there, that I never\nreally wanted to shower in. This was also the room where Grandpa\nSundahl&rsquo;s tools were.</p>\n<p>In the kitchen the sink was straight ahead as you entered with a window\nto the back yard yard. I remember using the hand mixer in that sink\nhundreds of times to make more bubbles out of the dish soap. To the\nright of the sink was a stack of shelves. The third door down was the\nmagic drawer. There was always a package of M&amp;M&rsquo;s for each of us, and\nthis was where Grandma kept the matches for her cigarettes, which we hid\nendlessly. Behind the sink was the gas stove and refrigerator. A felix\nthe cat clock was on the wall over the small kitchen table.</p>\n<p>In the living room was a black and white television. If we wanted to\nwatch Rocky and Bullwinkle we would have to turn the rotor to point the\nantenna towards Sioux Falls in the west. Sadly, Lawrence Welk was\nnon-negotiable and required the rotor to point the antenna towards\nMankato in the Northwest.</p>\n<p>The upstairs was my personal kingdom. The stairway divided the small\ndormer style upstairs room into two halves. There was a half-wall around\nthe stair to keep you from falling, and we would endlessly pile up\ngrandma&rsquo;s pillows on a blanket that we stretched across and over the\nstair. We would call grandma to come upstairs and then drop the pillows\non her. Amazingly she never caught on.</p>\n<p>In Storden we were allowed to walk anywhere on our own. We could go to\nWitt&rsquo;s grocery store and get groceries for grandma, and of course a\npushup, or some other ice cream treat for our efforts. As far as I\nremember no money was exchanged everything was done on account. Down the\nroad from the grocery store was the elementary school with swings,\nteeter totters, and of course the tall metal slippery slide with a big\nhump in the middle. Nothing was made of plastic in those days, there\nwere no soft recycled bits of anything to land in at the bottom of the\nslide.</p>\n<p>You may be wondering why I&rsquo;ve just written four paragraphs of memories\nabout small town Minnesota life in the late 60&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;m in the\nmiddle of Cambodia. Actually I&rsquo;m a bit surprised myself, but once I\nstarted, the memories kept following one after the other, and it seemed\nright to get them down. Maybe this blog needs a good editor! Still, its\na valid question.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about those early days as I&rsquo;ve been traveling\nthrough Vietnam and now Cambodia these last few weeks. Its not a\nconscious effort on my part, the memories just keep arising as we drive\naround.</p>\n<p>My learning style is to make connections between things I know and the\nthings I&rsquo;m learning. I find patterns, and make associations. You may be\nwondering what connections and parallels I see between Southwest\nMinnesota and the Southeast Asian countries of Vietnam and Cambodia. To\nme the parallels are obvious.</p>\n<p>For me, these memories of my childhood represent a simple &ldquo;make do&rdquo;\nstyle of living. We had fun, but it wasn&rsquo;t expensive and it wasn&rsquo;t\ncomplicated. Later in life I learned that my Mom, the oldest child, and\ngrandma and grandpa had lived in the basement for a period in order to\nsave the money to build the rest of the house.</p>\n<p>### Here we pick up the thread several months later</p>\n<p>After four months in Malta and around the Mediterranean, I think I\nunderstand why I was writing a lot of what I wrote.

				"content_text": "\n# Lifestyle Reflections\n\nNote: I wrote the first part of this post as a draft, while in Cambodia,\nand then forgot to \"un-draft\" it. So I just realized four months later\nthat it has not been finished or published. I will finish and publish it\nnow.\n\nSome of my earliest memories are of a small house in a small town in\nSouthwestern Minnesota in the late 1960's. My Grandma Sundahl lived in\nthis house. As you came in the side door, you could turn left and go up\na few stairs to the kitchen, or straight down the stairs to the\nbasement. The basement had three rooms, a laundry room off to the left\nas you went down the stairs. I remember big crockery bowls on the\ncounter in that room and a big black adding machine that we could play\nwith endlessly. To the right was a cinder block room with a cement\nfloor. Grandma had painted the walls and decorated them with big posters\nof the Campbell Soup kids. There was a ping pong table at one end. As\nfar as I can remebmer the other end of that room was open for us to run\naround in. Straight ahead as you reached the bottom of the stairs was\nthe big dark scary room. there was a shower in there, that I never\nreally wanted to shower in. This was also the room where Grandpa\nSundahl's tools were.\n\nIn the kitchen the sink was straight ahead as you entered with a window\nto the back yard yard. I remember using the hand mixer in that sink\nhundreds of times to make more bubbles out of the dish soap. To the\nright of the sink was a stack of shelves. The third door down was the\nmagic drawer. There was always a package of M&M's for each of us, and\nthis was where Grandma kept the matches for her cigarettes, which we hid\nendlessly. Behind the sink was the gas stove and refrigerator. A felix\nthe cat clock was on the wall over the small kitchen table.\n\nIn the living room was a black and white television. If we wanted to\nwatch Rocky and Bullwinkle we would have to turn the rotor to point the\nantenna towards Sioux Falls in the west. Sadly, Lawrence Welk was\nnon-negotiable and required the rotor to point the antenna towards\nMankato in the Northwest.\n\nThe upstairs was my personal kingdom. The stairway divided the small\ndormer style upstairs room into two halves. There was a half-wall around\nthe stair to keep you from falling, and we would endlessly pile up\ngrandma's pillows on a blanket that we stretched across and over the\nstair. We would call grandma to come upstairs and then drop the pillows\non her. Amazingly she never caught on.\n\nIn Storden we were allowed to walk anywhere on our own. We could go to\nWitt's grocery store and get groceries for grandma, and of course a\npushup, or some other ice cream treat for our efforts. As far as I\nremember no money was exchanged everything was done on account. Down the\nroad from the grocery store was the elementary school with swings,\nteeter totters, and of course the tall metal slippery slide with a big\nhump in the middle. Nothing was made of plastic in those days, there\nwere no soft recycled bits of anything to land in at the bottom of the\nslide.\n\nYou may be wondering why I've just written four paragraphs of memories\nabout small town Minnesota life in the late 60's when I'm in the\nmiddle of Cambodia. Actually I'm a bit surprised myself, but once I\nstarted, the memories kept following one after the other, and it seemed\nright to get them down. Maybe this blog needs a good editor! Still, its\na valid question.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about those early days as I've been traveling\nthrough Vietnam and now Cambodia these last few weeks. Its not a\nconscious effort on my part, the memories just keep arising as we drive\naround.\n\nMy learning style is to make connections between things I know and the\nthings I'm learning. I find patterns, and make associations. You may be\nwondering what connections and parallels I see between Southwest\nMinnesota and the Southeast Asian countries of Vietnam and Cambodia. To\nme the parallels are obvious.\n\nFor me, these memories of my childhood represent a simple \"make do\"\nstyle of living. We had fun, but it wasn't expensive and it wasn't\ncomplicated. Later in life I learned that my Mom, the oldest child, and\ngrandma and grandpa had lived in the basement for a period in order to\nsave the money to build the rest of the house.\n\n\\### Here we pick up the thread several months later\n\nAfter four months in Malta and around the Mediterranean, I think I\nunderstand why I was writing a lot of what I wrote. I comes down to\nthinking about your own lifestyle. The stark contrast in January between\nmy own lavish lifetyle and the lifestyle I've lived in Malta these last\nfour months is pretty amazing. I have learned to live with **a lot**\nless than I do at home, I have learned to enjoy cooking and eating even\nwithout my gourmet kitchen, I have accomplished a lot of development\nwork on projects that I am truly passionate about with nothing but a\nlaptop and an internet connection.\n\nThe flat we live in was built in the 1950's probably a decade after the\nhouse in Storden was built. There is almost nothing in common between\nthis long narrow limestone flat, and the house in Storden other than the\nshared experiences of the members of the generation that built each\nstructure.\n\nOne of the interesting things about Malta is that the tension between\nthe generations is more evident to me on Malta than it is in my own\ncountry. There is a real sadness among the older generation about how\nthe island has changed in the last 30 years, and i guess I honestly\ncan't say how the younger generation feels, but I can observe their\nactions as they overbuild, and overuse the limited resources available\nto them on the island.\n",

As we rounded the staircase onto the second floor we were met with\nthe title for the main gallery on that floor: &ldquo;War Crimes of America&rdquo;\nWow! I wasn&rsquo;t expecting that. Suddenly I felt very uncomfortable.\nThroughout the museum we were confronted with images and stories of\nAgent Orange, senseless killings, Graphs depicting the numbers of bombs\ndropped on Vietnam in various years, and the use of Napalm. Clearly\nmuseums are not just dry exhibitions of facts, but can have their own\npoint of view.</p>\n<p>Sunday, 10:00 a.m.: Our first stop today is at a family run restaurant\nof the girl, Kim Phuc, she is widely known as &ldquo;The girl in the\npicture&rdquo; A pulitzer prize winning photo that many say galvanized the\nantiwar movement in the United States. It is a haunting photo, and the\nrest of her story is very moving. It is not easy to hear, it is even\nmore difficult to imagine that our country would do that to a child.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/15e1d9d141.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<p>Sunday, 1:00 p.m.: Our final stop of the day is at the Cu Chi tunnels\nwhere we meet a Viet Cong veteran, and watch a 1967 documentary that\nextolls the virtues of the &ldquo;war heroes&rdquo; who killed many americans, and\ndestroyed many American Tanks. We learn about the cleverness and the\nbravery of the Viet Cong who set booby traps to kill the Americans, and\nlived in the tunnels of Cu Chi for years.</p>\n<p>Monday, 4 a.m.: I awoke with a start, my heart was pounding, and my\nthoughts were already on the day ahead. Today was a biking day in the\nMekong Delta, but tonight was our &ldquo;home stay&rdquo; night. I was a little\npanicked. Our guide had informed us last night that there would be no\nhot water and no air conditioning at our home stay. The high today would\nbe over 90 degrees, and the humidity about what you would expect in the\nJungle. We saw a lot of houses that I would not want to stay in the\nprevious day. I think to myself, &ldquo;Is there any way to get out of this?\nWhy would I want to do a home stay when I am in this really nice\nhotel?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Tuesday, 1:30PM: Our guide invites me to turn around, so that he can\ndrape a Python over my shoulders.

				"content_text": "\n# Out of my Comfort Zone\n\nThe following post appears on the Luther College [Ideas and Creations\nBlog](https://www.luther.edu/ideas-creations-blog/)\n\nSaturday, 12:30 p.m.: Our guide told us the best way of visiting the war\nmuseum here in Saigon is to start on the third floor and work your way\ndown. As we rounded the staircase onto the second floor we were met with\nthe title for the main gallery on that floor: \"War Crimes of America\"\nWow! I wasn't expecting that. Suddenly I felt very uncomfortable.\nThroughout the museum we were confronted with images and stories of\nAgent Orange, senseless killings, Graphs depicting the numbers of bombs\ndropped on Vietnam in various years, and the use of Napalm. Clearly\nmuseums are not just dry exhibitions of facts, but can have their own\npoint of view.\n\nSunday, 10:00 a.m.: Our first stop today is at a family run restaurant\nof the girl, Kim Phuc, she is widely known as \"The girl in the\npicture\" A pulitzer prize winning photo that many say galvanized the\nantiwar movement in the United States. It is a haunting photo, and the\nrest of her story is very moving. It is not easy to hear, it is even\nmore difficult to imagine that our country would do that to a child.\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/15e1d9d141.jpg)\n\nSunday, 1:00 p.m.: Our final stop of the day is at the Cu Chi tunnels\nwhere we meet a Viet Cong veteran, and watch a 1967 documentary that\nextolls the virtues of the \"war heroes\" who killed many americans, and\ndestroyed many American Tanks. We learn about the cleverness and the\nbravery of the Viet Cong who set booby traps to kill the Americans, and\nlived in the tunnels of Cu Chi for years.\n\nMonday, 4 a.m.: I awoke with a start, my heart was pounding, and my\nthoughts were already on the day ahead. Today was a biking day in the\nMekong Delta, but tonight was our \"home stay\" night. I was a little\npanicked. Our guide had informed us last night that there would be no\nhot water and no air conditioning at our home stay. The high today would\nbe over 90 degrees, and the humidity about what you would expect in the\nJungle. We saw a lot of houses that I would not want to stay in the\nprevious day. I think to myself, \"Is there any way to get out of this?\nWhy would I want to do a home stay when I am in this really nice\nhotel?\"\n\nTuesday, 1:30PM: Our guide invites me to turn around, so that he can\ndrape a Python over my shoulders. I have a lifelong fear of snakes, and\nas you can see, this is a big one. However, since I teach a programming\nlanguage by the same name, and I know that many of my first year\nstudents struggle with the language, it somehow seems appropriate for me\nto over come that fear, and so the snake goes around my shoulders.\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/82f3996308.jpg)\n\nWhen my wife Jane and I told people we were going to Vietnam, we saw\nmany different reactions: confused, worried, envious, and even\npeevishness.

When its done we wrap it up in some rice paper with herbs and\nsalad. Then you make a quick dipping sauce to accompany the rolls. After\nthe demonstration we are told to leave our recipes at our seats and to\nfind a station.

Today was our first official lesson, at the\nRed Bridge Cooking School.\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ca1312c6ad.jpg)\n\nOur day started out with a tour of the market, which was nothing new,\nexcept that this time we were guided around by Chef Luna. For the tour\nwe were put into groups of four. We met a very nice couple from\nSouthampton England and had great conversation with them all day. Phil\nand Jane. It even turns out that her maiden name was Jane Miller, so\nwhat are the odds of that?\n\nAfter the market tour we took a boat ride out to the restaurant and\ncooking school, and had another brief tour of their herb garden. We are\ngetting lots of ideas for things to plant in our own garden next summer\nthat we hope will grow in the Iowa summer.\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/32b36ced6e.jpg)\n\nThen its time for the real lessons to begin. We each get a clipboard\nwith seven pages of recipes! Luna demonstrates how to make our first\ncourse. This is a rice flour pancake with shrimp and pork and green\nonion. When its done we wrap it up in some rice paper with herbs and\nsalad. Then you make a quick dipping sauce to accompany the rolls. After\nthe demonstration we are told to leave our recipes at our seats and to\nfind a station. Now it is time to cook!\n\nHere I am getting ready to make my pancake.\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8ed6a32a96.jpg)\n\nI'm really getting in a lot of healthy eating this trip. You just\ncan't avoid adding in all of the delicious vegetables to your dishes,\nand I have to admit they really do taste good. Who knows, this could be\nthe start of a whole new relationship with vegetables for me.\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/b2b99bdac2.jpg)\n\nThe pattern set in the first recipe was repeated several times. Our full\nmenu includes:\n\n-   Seafood Salad served in a Pineapple boat\n-   Fresh rice paper rolls of shrimp. Yes we learned how to make our own\n    rice paper!\n-   Vietnamese Eggplan in clay pot. I can't believe I ate eggplant and\n    actually liked it.\n-   Steamed ocean fish on a bed of fresh vegetables.\n\nIt was so fun to make everything, and we can't wait to recreate this\ncooking school experience for our friends back home.\n",

Where do you go after a day like that?</p>\n<p>Yesterday we left our hotel in the city and headed out to the Meekong\nDelta. This is an extremely fertile area where the Meekong river flows\ninto the Sea. We started our day loading our bikes onto a boat and we\nheaded up the river into the delta.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4f15bc80c8.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<p>We made a stop along the way at a brick factory. It is such a step back\nin time, to visit a factory like this in Vietnam. We simply got off the\nboat and wandered around talking to a few of the workers. No badges\nrequired, no hard helmets, no insurance waivers. Its a pretty simple\nprocess, clay comes out of the river, and goes into a little hand\noperated machine that mikes the clay and extrudes the bricks. After\ndrying on their own for a few weeks they eventually make it into a big\nkiln which is fired by rice husks.</p>\n<p>We got off the boat, along with our bikes at another small factory, this\ntime they were making all kinds of things out of coconuts. Coconut\nwater, candy, coconut milk, shaved coconut. If it was possible to\nsqueeze another product out of coconut they would find a way to do it.\nBefore we set off on our bikes we had a whole plate of fruit to try.\nIncluding dipping your fresh pineapple into a mixture of salt and chile\npeppers -- delicious. I ate more fruit yesterday than I have in a year.\nWhich isn&rsquo;t saying much good about my diet, I know.</p>\n<p>After an hour or so of biking through the tiny backroads of the delta we\nstopped for lunch. A great outdoor restaurant that basically appeared\nout of nowhere. One minute we were biking through the trees and the next\nwe were pulling into a &ldquo;neighborhood restaurant.&rdquo; Our first course was\nfried spring rolls. Love em. Our second consisted of a whole Elephant\nEar fish, fried and presented standup style for us. For you aquarium\nkeepers this is also known as a Giant Gourami. I&rsquo;ve had gouramis in my\naquarium before, but I never thought I&rsquo;d eat one. Anyway, we learned\nhow to eat this by rolling the fish, along with some rice noodles and\nsome pineapple and cucumber and mint, and basil in rice paper. The third\ncourse was a noodle soup which also had two giant prawns for us to try.\nThen came a course which consisted of a bowl of rice and some chicken\ncurry. Of course by this time we were totally stuffed, and leaving all\nkinds of food on the table. So of course they have to bring dessert.\nWell, more fruit at least.</p>\n<p>I honestly do not know how all of the vietnamese people stay so healthy\nand slim. From what I have observed in the last three days they eat\ninsane quantities of food.</p>\n<p>After lunch we do a bunch more biking, and then end up at our\n&ldquo;homestay&rdquo; house. This was the part of the trip that had me the most\nnervous. Honestly, I like my nice hotels, I&rsquo;m really more of an\nintrovert when it comes to meeting new people, so showing up at\nsomeone&rsquo;s house in the middle of the delta, knowing in advance that the\nhouse did not have air conditioning, internet, or hot water seemed like\na bad idea. But it all worked out.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f310744917.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<p>One of the great highlights of the evening was our spring roll lesson.\nYep, in a real Vietnamese kitchen I got to learn first hand how to make\none of my all time favorite foods.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f2fcb3697d.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<p>It was a pretty early night, and as it turned out pretty sleepless as\nwell. We were hot, and our mattress was pretty hard, &ldquo;softer than\ncement&rdquo; according to Jane. So it was early to bed early to rise. We had\na quick breakfast, and then biked to the local market. In the delta,\nlocally grown is not a &ldquo;movement,&rdquo; it is a way of life, and has been\nfor years. The pork that is sold fresh at the market was butchered just\nhours ago, and it will all be consumed before the day is out. Fish, eel,\nfrogs, etc. are all still alive and swimming when you get there, when\nyou pick out what you want they will fillet them for you. It was all\ncaught today, and it will all be eaten today. The produce is a similar\nstory with more kinds of fruits and vegetables available than I can even\nthink about.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/3e093c2b73.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<p>After the local market we meet up with our driver again, and we head\nsomewhere else on the delta to visit the Cai Be floating market. This is\nsimilar to the local market but here things come, by boat, from further\naway. Each boat sells its specialty, and you can tell what they are\nselling because they have it flying from a flagpole on the boat!</p>\n<p>Here is where things take a turn for the weird. It seems that Long has\ndecided we need to be challenged. So after we get off the boat and bike\nfor a few feet, he stops and says he wants to show us &ldquo;how they make\nhoney&rdquo; OK, fine we get to see a beehive, but thats not enough, as he\nwants me to hold it. There must be a thousand bees on this thing and he\nwants me to just stay calm and hold the thing.</p>\n<p>That turned out to be easy compared to the next lesson: a big jar, whats\nin the jar?

				"content_text": "\n# The Meekong Delta\n\nThe Meekong Delta\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/389b38af94.jpg)\n\nThe picture pretty much sums up our experience here the last two days.\nWe have both pushed ourselves outside our comfort zone, we have tried\nmany new foods, and even took a sip of rice wine that had been\nmarinating with cobra! Where do you go after a day like that?\n\nYesterday we left our hotel in the city and headed out to the Meekong\nDelta. This is an extremely fertile area where the Meekong river flows\ninto the Sea. We started our day loading our bikes onto a boat and we\nheaded up the river into the delta.\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4f15bc80c8.jpg)\n\nWe made a stop along the way at a brick factory. It is such a step back\nin time, to visit a factory like this in Vietnam. We simply got off the\nboat and wandered around talking to a few of the workers. No badges\nrequired, no hard helmets, no insurance waivers. Its a pretty simple\nprocess, clay comes out of the river, and goes into a little hand\noperated machine that mikes the clay and extrudes the bricks. After\ndrying on their own for a few weeks they eventually make it into a big\nkiln which is fired by rice husks.\n\nWe got off the boat, along with our bikes at another small factory, this\ntime they were making all kinds of things out of coconuts. Coconut\nwater, candy, coconut milk, shaved coconut. If it was possible to\nsqueeze another product out of coconut they would find a way to do it.\nBefore we set off on our bikes we had a whole plate of fruit to try.\nIncluding dipping your fresh pineapple into a mixture of salt and chile\npeppers \\-- delicious. I ate more fruit yesterday than I have in a year.\nWhich isn't saying much good about my diet, I know.\n\nAfter an hour or so of biking through the tiny backroads of the delta we\nstopped for lunch. A great outdoor restaurant that basically appeared\nout of nowhere. One minute we were biking through the trees and the next\nwe were pulling into a \"neighborhood restaurant.\" Our first course was\nfried spring rolls. Love em. Our second consisted of a whole Elephant\nEar fish, fried and presented standup style for us. For you aquarium\nkeepers this is also known as a Giant Gourami. I've had gouramis in my\naquarium before, but I never thought I'd eat one. Anyway, we learned\nhow to eat this by rolling the fish, along with some rice noodles and\nsome pineapple and cucumber and mint, and basil in rice paper. The third\ncourse was a noodle soup which also had two giant prawns for us to try.\nThen came a course which consisted of a bowl of rice and some chicken\ncurry. Of course by this time we were totally stuffed, and leaving all\nkinds of food on the table. So of course they have to bring dessert.\nWell, more fruit at least.\n\nI honestly do not know how all of the vietnamese people stay so healthy\nand slim. From what I have observed in the last three days they eat\ninsane quantities of food.\n\nAfter lunch we do a bunch more biking, and then end up at our\n\"homestay\" house. This was the part of the trip that had me the most\nnervous. Honestly, I like my nice hotels, I'm really more of an\nintrovert when it comes to meeting new people, so showing up at\nsomeone's house in the middle of the delta, knowing in advance that the\nhouse did not have air conditioning, internet, or hot water seemed like\na bad idea. But it all worked out.\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f310744917.jpg)\n\nOne of the great highlights of the evening was our spring roll lesson.\nYep, in a real Vietnamese kitchen I got to learn first hand how to make\none of my all time favorite foods.\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f2fcb3697d.jpg)\n\nIt was a pretty early night, and as it turned out pretty sleepless as\nwell. We were hot, and our mattress was pretty hard, \"softer than\ncement\" according to Jane. So it was early to bed early to rise. We had\na quick breakfast, and then biked to the local market. In the delta,\nlocally grown is not a \"movement,\" it is a way of life, and has been\nfor years. The pork that is sold fresh at the market was butchered just\nhours ago, and it will all be consumed before the day is out. Fish, eel,\nfrogs, etc. are all still alive and swimming when you get there, when\nyou pick out what you want they will fillet them for you. It was all\ncaught today, and it will all be eaten today. The produce is a similar\nstory with more kinds of fruits and vegetables available than I can even\nthink about.\n\n![image](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/3e093c2b73.jpg)\n\nAfter the local market we meet up with our driver again, and we head\nsomewhere else on the delta to visit the Cai Be floating market. This is\nsimilar to the local market but here things come, by boat, from further\naway. Each boat sells its specialty, and you can tell what they are\nselling because they have it flying from a flagpole on the boat!\n\nHere is where things take a turn for the weird. It seems that Long has\ndecided we need to be challenged. So after we get off the boat and bike\nfor a few feet, he stops and says he wants to show us \"how they make\nhoney\" OK, fine we get to see a beehive, but thats not enough, as he\nwants me to hold it. There must be a thousand bees on this thing and he\nwants me to just stay calm and hold the thing.\n\nThat turned out to be easy compared to the next lesson: a big jar, whats\nin the jar? Looks like snakes to me. Gross. Have I mentioned my lifelong\nfear of snakes? OK, so its a jar full of rice wine and snakes. Lets see\nwhat kind of snake? Oooooh a Cobra, glad its dead and pickled. Glad he\ndidn't tell me they were lurking around on the delta until now. Lets\nhave a toast shall we? Um, really? you want me to drink rice wine that\nhas been marinating a dead cobra? Fine.

After pulling it out of its cage,\nand informing us that it is not poisonous, but does bite. He says, ok\nBrad, your turn. Really! I can assure you that holding a giant Python\nhas never been on my list of things I want to try.

				"content_text": "\n# Advent, Anticipation, Adventure\n\nIn the Christian church, Advent is a season of waiting, a season of\nanticipation. Normally, we are waiting and anticipating the celebration\nof the birth of Christ. Christmas! This year is no different, but it is\na bit hard to not look just past Christmas at what awaits us in the new\nyear. Adventure. I never thought about the fact that adventure begins\nwith advent.\n\nOn January first, we will board a plane for Vietnam. We'll spend three\nweeks in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, and then head to our home for\nthe Spring semester on the Island of Malta. We've been telling people\nthat Vietnam is right on the way to Malta. On January 30th our 12 Luther\nstudents will join us and move in to one of the three flats in Sliema,\njust two blocks from this amazing view. I have to pinch myself just\nthinking that I'm going to be living on an island in the Mediterranean\nfor five months.\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe src=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/mescon/2961313246/in/photolist-bw3J3v-nsacXX-eAXeSV-4XByoU-buBStF-fncN4A-aCn8fQ-8wrBiN-EKVmG-iT5pHh-fBz4Fc-nQ2iiZ-5vFvfW-gMqXtR-YKcqC-byUzxg-d36rqy-dsqdqy-crnCLN-9temwv-h6rZ59-boPTbr-cAURjA-dY98S7-8AADhy-ggqjZE-oA6WGf-99cydS-4YnP48-75JNvi-5EvcEe-gV1E52-8eGQyt-croDhJ-nBwrx-efFrZL-e2yfuv-h1Ck19-nTFX35-dUzY6x-9rbJ3J-eP6age-dWP7U8-dsp1uB-npLMaz-brYnRf-iGDSm-9ts3nj-4WkiMT-eQhYLy/player/\" width=\"500\" height=\"246\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen></iframe>\n```\nOur students begin classes February second.

				"content_text": "\nDuring my January travels, I also converted this blog from tubmlr, which had been frustrating me for a while, to Octopress, with which I have been very happy.  Nothing like hacker level control of your own blog.  But more, than just the switch in tools, the move to Octopress inspired me to make it easier for people to publish small or large works using the Runestone tools.\n\n\n\nYesterday, at the Learning @ Scale conference we demoed this new capability.  See [the demo here](<http://runestoneinteractive.org/LearningAtScale).  To make it super easy to publish:\n\n\n\n* Lecture slides\n\n* Demonstrations\n\n* A Tutorial\n\n* Lab Instructions\n\n* In class exercises\n\n* A short module on your favorite topic not covered elsewhere\n\n* An entire book\n\n\n\n<!-- TEASER_END -->\n\n\n\n### Building\n\n\n\nYou can simply follow the instructions at this new repository:  [github.com/RunestoneInteractive/RunestoneTools](http://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/RunestoneTools).  In a nutshell:\n\n\n\n1.  Install Sphinx, paver, and paverutils using pip.\n\n2.  Clone the repository\n\n3.  Edit the index.rst file in source, and add any additional rst files you may want, depending on how complex your project is.\n\n4.  run ``paver build``\n\n\n\n### Deploying\n\n\n\nNow you have a choice.  In the build directory you have a nice self contained set of html files, these files are set up to make use of the runestone server invisibly in the background.  The static html can be served from any web server.  Just drop in the build directory and you are ready to serve.  OR, you can now host and deploy your project using **GitHub Pages**.  To host on github pages you need to do three things.\n\n\n\n1.  Create an empty repository in your github account.\n\n2.  run `paver setup_github_pages` and paste in the URL of the new account.\n\n3.  run paver deploy\n\n\n\nNow your pages will be available at:  http://youraccount.github.io/YourRepo\n\nIf you want to host these pages behind a custom domain name, you can follow the instructions on github for doing so.

				"content_html": "<p>My daughter Kaia is getting married next summer.  This is not new news, the proposal was made an accepted last June.  But planning is in full swing now, and I was kind of excited when secured a visit with Capsule, because capsule provides a service where all the guests at your wedding can download the capsule app and it will automatically upload all the photos to a special page for the wedding.</p>\n<p>This company was founded by Cyrus, who set out to solve a simple problem, a problem we&rsquo;ve been coping with on this course as well.  When you travel, how do you share all your digital photos with the buddies you are traveling with.  When you have a big party?  When you have a wedding, bachelor party, bachelorette party?  Capsule has solved this in a nice, elegant way.  All the photos uploaded for a particular event, are shared with the participants in the event.  Its that easy.  No need to bore all of your Facebook followers with every photo from your trip.  If you&rsquo;re an Instagram user, its super easy to add a special hashtag to your photo and it will be automatically imported into Capsule as well as shared on Instagram.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>What was incredibly interesting for me was to listen to Cyrus talk about business models, and monetizing the service.  Cyrus is not a CS guy, he&rsquo;s a business guy.  Of course as an entrepreneur he can talk the tech talk but his home is on the business side.  Here&rsquo;s an example of how differently we tech people approach a problem than the business guys.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Each event needs to have a unique id, that can be given to the participants to use to join the event, and/or tag their Instagram photos.</p>\n<p><strong>Tech Solution:</strong> Ha, this is easy, we&rsquo;ll just allow people to pick a unique identifier, lets say <code>#TannerAndKaia</code> No problem, this is easy just give them a text entry box, and a quick database lookup to make sure the hashtag hasn&rsquo;t already been taken.  No big deal, even an intern could code this up.</p>\n<p><strong>Business Guy Solution:</strong>  Ok, just generate a random hashtag <code>#JK286TJ</code>.  Now if the bride and the groom want to have a nice hashtag for their wedding, we can sell them that as a strategy to monetize the service.</p>\n<p>Brilliant!  We tech guys get so focused on the solution most of the time that we never stop to think about simple strategies to monetize.</p>\n<p>Our second visit of the day was to <a href=\"http://fullscreen.net\" title=\"Fullscreen\">Fullscreen</a>.  This is a Culver City company that employs three Luther Alumni!  Two of which I am very proud to say are also alumni of this very course.  Drew is employee number 3 of Fullscreen, and Aaron is number 15, Jacob is not far after Aaron.  Fullscreen now numbers over 220 employees, and is a very fast growing new media company.</p>\n<p>What do they do?  What do you mean new media company?  Well, this is where my age really starts to show.  Apparently there are people in this world that spend a lot of time watching &ldquo;shows&rdquo; on youTube.  Shows like that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/JennaMarbles\" title=\"JennaMarbles\">Marbles girl</a>, or teenagegirl14, and thousands of others.  As Aaron said, this is not your demographic Brad, this is targeted at a group of people that will probably never pay a cable bill.  So Fullscreen is a Network in the sense that they aggregate all kinds of these new generation entertainers, and help them monetize their videos on youtube.  Note that monetize is a euphemism for ad serving, but thats really only a small part of what Fullscreen is about.  Its a great company and Drew, Aaron, and Jacob were excellent hosts.  They even talked their CEO into spending about an hour with us answering questions.</p>\n<p>Another interesting story around Fullscreen is that Drew and George (CEO of Fullscreen) met at Coloft Santa Monica.  We were also lucky enough to meet with the founder of Coloft, Avesta, (@avestar). He gave the students  a great no-nonsense talk on his views of entrepreneurship. The story of Drew meeting George is a great example of the synergies that can happen in a co-working facility.  At the time, Drew and a partner were trying to start a little consulting company to do coding for hire.  Avesta happened to be talking to George who was looking for someone with Drew&rsquo;s skill set.  So he introduced the two of them, and a successful company was launched.</p>\n<p>I love this story on a couple of different levels.  First, as a professor I take pride in the success and accomplishments of my students even after they leave the campus.  As an alum and faculty member of a college that counts community as one of its defining characteristics, it is great to find other organizations that lift up community as a differentiator.</p>\n",

Here's an example of how differently we tech people approach a problem than the business guys.\n\n\n\n**Problem:** Each event needs to have a unique id, that can be given to the participants to use to join the event, and/or tag their Instagram photos.\n\n\n\n**Tech Solution:** Ha, this is easy, we'll just allow people to pick a unique identifier, lets say `#TannerAndKaia` No problem, this is easy just give them a text entry box, and a quick database lookup to make sure the hashtag hasn't already been taken.  No big deal, even an intern could code this up.\n\n\n\n**Business Guy Solution:**  Ok, just generate a random hashtag `#JK286TJ`.  Now if the bride and the groom want to have a nice hashtag for their wedding, we can sell them that as a strategy to monetize the service.\n\n\n\nBrilliant!  We tech guys get so focused on the solution most of the time that we never stop to think about simple strategies to monetize.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur second visit of the day was to [Fullscreen](http://fullscreen.net \"Fullscreen\").  This is a Culver City company that employs three Luther Alumni!  Two of which I am very proud to say are also alumni of this very course.  Drew is employee number 3 of Fullscreen, and Aaron is number 15, Jacob is not far after Aaron.  Fullscreen now numbers over 220 employees, and is a very fast growing new media company.  \n\n\n\nWhat do they do?  What do you mean new media company?  Well, this is where my age really starts to show.  Apparently there are people in this world that spend a lot of time watching \"shows\" on youTube.  Shows like that [Marbles girl](http://www.youtube.com/user/JennaMarbles \"JennaMarbles\"), or teenagegirl14, and thousands of others.  As Aaron said, this is not your demographic Brad, this is targeted at a group of people that will probably never pay a cable bill.  So Fullscreen is a Network in the sense that they aggregate all kinds of these new generation entertainers, and help them monetize their videos on youtube.  Note that monetize is a euphemism for ad serving, but thats really only a small part of what Fullscreen is about.  Its a great company and Drew, Aaron, and Jacob were excellent hosts.  They even talked their CEO into spending about an hour with us answering questions.\n\n\n\nAnother interesting story around Fullscreen is that Drew and George (CEO of Fullscreen) met at Coloft Santa Monica.  We were also lucky enough to meet with the founder of Coloft, Avesta, (@avestar). He gave the students  a great no-nonsense talk on his views of entrepreneurship. The story of Drew meeting George is a great example of the synergies that can happen in a co-working facility.  At the time, Drew and a partner were trying to start a little consulting company to do coding for hire.  Avesta happened to be talking to George who was looking for someone with Drew's skill set.  So he introduced the two of them, and a successful company was launched.  \n\n\n\nI love this story on a couple of different levels.  First, as a professor I take pride in the success and accomplishments of my students even after they leave the campus.  As an alum and faculty member of a college that counts community as one of its defining characteristics, it is great to find other organizations that lift up community as a differentiator.\n",

The result of this is that VC's are able to make bets on software companies for a relatively small amount of money.  The downside is that they may not be investing in the riskier, bigger companies that may result in really big breakthroughs.\n\n\n\nFor my own, and your convenience, here is a list of words of wisdom and interesting companies to check out:\n\n\n\n* You need to know Atlassian, Github, and Sonatype\n\n* Think about *Engagement Moments* These are the times that people are really paying attention to their devices and are good times to hit them up with an ad.\n\n* Learn Hadooop\n\n* Writing SQL is a requirement for everyone\n\n* Plumgrid\n\n* Hortonworks\n\n* MongoDB\n\n* Puppet and Chef\n\n* Nuodb\n\n* Baynote\n",

Architects want to have a good strong lasting implementation, and tend to plan the whole system out before coding.  Hackers, tend to code as they think, and the best of them have an idea coded by the end of the meeting where it was first introduced.  Where are you on that spectrum?  The Designers interpret the vision to the builders, they own the problem space, and understand the user experience.  In the best case, the builder and the designer are the same person.  Finally, the Closer, usually a sales person, often also the CEO is the person who can close the deal.\n\n\n\n* The better a company is at serving their customers, the less likely the are to change.  This of course goes against every lesson Steve Jobs and others like him taught us.  You need to make yourself obsolete before someone else does.  In an aside, I think this lesson right here is the achilles heel of higher education.\n",

				"title": "chapel talk - 11/4  nehemiah 13 1-3, 23-31",
				"content_html": "<p>This is the text from my chapel talk yesterday.  The video (mostly of the top of my head) can be found on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Luther Portal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Make sure you go to the On Demand tab and look for me on November 4.</p>\n<p>I’m going to begin today with a slightly different opening litany than we have become accustomed to:  When my friend Ann Highum asked me to switch days with her I said “sure”  after all one days reading can’t be that much harder than another.  Then I got the email from Pastor David.  It contained three very ominous words:  “these troubling texts”.  Not to mention that our reading today is from the book of Nehemiah.  Lets begin with our reading:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On that day they read from the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God, 2 because they did not meet the Israelites with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them—yet our God turned the curse into a blessing. 3 When the people heard the law, they separated from Israel all those of foreign descent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>OK, discrimination, xenophobia, that sounds troubling enough to get started.  We’ll come back to versus 23-31 in a moment.  This is not your typical sunday school reading.  Who are the Ammonites or the Moabites?  What did they do to deserve getting kicked out?  I think we might need a bit of context.</p>\n<p>Now it turns out that the book of Nehemiah is essentially a blog written by Nehemiah himself, who was the cupbearer for King Ataxerxes.  So I thought as a public service I would try to give some context to todays reading by condensing Nehemiah’s blog posts into a series of tweets.   A sort of Twitter translation of the bible with commentary from yours truly. Nehemiah himself goes by @cupbearer21 in case you want to follow him on Twitter later today.</p>\n<h3 id=\"posts-from-the-month-of-chislev\">Posts from the month of Chislev:</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Brother Hanani came to Susa today, brought visitors from Judah</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>OMG the wall of Jeursalem is broken and the gates destroyed by fire!  #JerusalemFire</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’ve been weeping, fasting, and praying for days.  Still distraught over the fire in Jerusalem.  #WoeIsMe</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Next, we get some insight into the incredible guilt and potentially inflated sense of self importance that @cupbearer21 must feel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Can’t help but feel that the #JerusalemFire is my fault!   Me and my family must have offended @God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"now-we-skip-to-the-month-of-nisan\">Now we skip to the month of Nisan</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AtaXerxes told me to buck up.  I guess he can tell I’m still sad over #JerusalemFire</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just days later we get the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Holy career path! @ataxerxes granted my request to go to Judah and rebuild the walls of Jerusalem!   #ClimbTheRoyalLadder</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now to be sure that he does not encounter opposition on the journey he tweets:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If anyone doubts me here’s a link to letters from @ataxerxes granting me safe passage and timber from the royal forest.  #TheKingsGotMyBack</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But Nehemiah’s glee is short lived, just days later we learn:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Curses! @TobiahtheAmmonite is not happy with me. He will try to foil my plans for rebuilding the wall!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ahh, so we have a bit of dramatic foreshadowing on this deal with the Ammonites.  Our story continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Snuck out tonight to inspect the walls on my own.  #ThisPlaceIsAMess</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following the inspection, its time for the work on the walls to begin in earnest, but Nehemiah needs workers so he tweets out a plea for help:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Join me! we are going to rebuild the walls!  The hand of my God is gracious!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code> To which there are hundreds of replies of the form @cupbearer21 count me in!  @cupbearer21 tools ready to go, The hashtag #RebuildTheWalls was definitely trending that day.\n</code></pre>\n<p>But not everyone was on board with Nehemiah’s plans:  @SanballatTheHoronite and @TobiahTheAmmonite and @GeshemTheArab who basically responded</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>@cupbearer21 WT——H</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>@cupbearer21 Who do you think you are? Are you rebelling against the King?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nevertheless, Nehemiah we can tell work is proceeding by the status updates:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>High priest @eliashib doing good work on the sheep gate</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sons of @hassenaah rebuilt the fish gate today</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and so on with tweet after tweet of progress from around the city.</p>\n<p>Of course in typical twitter flamewar fashion we see some retweets from our old friends @SanballatTheHoronite and @TobiahTheAmmonite</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ha!  what are these feeble Jews doing?    Do they think they can rebuild the wall in a day1?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And from Tobiah,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That stone wall they are building — any fox would break it down!  #I’llHuffAndI’llPuff</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To which Nehemiah replies</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oh @God, do not blot out the sins of @Tobiahtheammonite  #FireyPitForYouDude</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some days later:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Big day today!!  Walls back to half their original height!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But even with all of that progress those darn Ammonites stirring up trouble again.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Emergency! We need families NOW to guard the walls against @sanballat and his ilk.  #NeedMoreSpears.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And although you might think I&rsquo;m making this one up, Nehemiah has been so busy that he tweets:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I’m starting to smell, its been weeks since I put down my spear and changed my clothes!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After all that, Nehemiah shows that he is a guy who can get things done.  After just 52 days he tweets</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At last, the wall is done!  #PartyAtMyHouse</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With the wall rebuilt, Nehemiah gets an interesting assignment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From @God:  Hey! @cupbearer21, You should use your analytics and do a genealogical and demographic analysis of the people</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At this point there are several chapters of names of Levites, and prophets and lineages of various families.  Clearly ancestry.com could have saved a bunch of time.</p>\n<p>So, rebuilding the wall is clearly the signature accomplishment of Nehemiah,  But even with all of his success as governor, Nehemiah doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of food and land allotments that were allowed him, because there was already such a great burden on the people.  He also made the other nobles and officials forgive all outstanding debts and ordered them to return all land and money that had been taken as taxes so the people would be able to feed themselves and their families.  To keep everyone happy he organizes covenant day which is summarized in the following tweet:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Covenant day!  #TithingIsGood  #OfferingsRock #FirstBornSonsToGod #FirstOfEverythingToGod</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which brings us again to Chapter 13 and these troubling tweets:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Much reform is needed @Elishib and @Tobiah have made a mess of things  #NoMixedMarriages #KeepMarriagePure</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kicked out the foreigners  #KeepTheIsreaelitesPure  #PureJerusalem</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in what must have felt like the ultimate victory for old Nehemiah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I chased @Jehoidia son-in-law of @SanballatTheHoronite away! He is gone from the city!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To which I now might imagine a response out of the future:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From @JCSofG,   Wait, What!? No No No!  #EatWithTaxCollectorsAndSinners!  #BadNehemia</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, does our story for today all come down to Nehemiah getting his revenge on the Ammonites for trying to thwart his efforts to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem?  It sure sounds like it. The sad thing is that In many ways this story seems all too familiar.  Take out Nehemiah and Insert the name of your favorite ruler:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Humble beginnings</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Great accomplishments and rise to power</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Power goes to the head</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stupid policies</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whats maybe more interesting to me is why this particular verse is the verse for the day, with all of the good things Nehemiah did, why highlight this one idiotic policy? Maybe simply to remind us that tolerance is a good thing even when times are tough.</p>\n<p>I’ve spent a lot of time this last week trying to answer the question, where’s the grace in this story? I think maybe for us and for Nehemiah it really does come down to his final tweet:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remember me @God for the good I have done!</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

After just 52 days he tweets\n\n\n\n> At last, the wall is done!  #PartyAtMyHouse\n\n\n\nWith the wall rebuilt, Nehemiah gets an interesting assignment:\n\n\n\n> From @God:  Hey! @cupbearer21, You should use your analytics and do a genealogical and demographic analysis of the people\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point there are several chapters of names of Levites, and prophets and lineages of various families.  Clearly ancestry.com could have saved a bunch of time.  \n\n\n\n\n\nSo, rebuilding the wall is clearly the signature accomplishment of Nehemiah,  But even with all of his success as governor, Nehemiah doesn't take advantage of food and land allotments that were allowed him, because there was already such a great burden on the people.  He also made the other nobles and officials forgive all outstanding debts and ordered them to return all land and money that had been taken as taxes so the people would be able to feed themselves and their families.  To keep everyone happy he organizes covenant day which is summarized in the following tweet:\n\n\n\n\n\n> Covenant day!  #TithingIsGood  #OfferingsRock #FirstBornSonsToGod #FirstOfEverythingToGod\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich brings us again to Chapter 13 and these troubling tweets:\n\n\n\n\n\n> Much reform is needed @Elishib and @Tobiah have made a mess of things  #NoMixedMarriages #KeepMarriagePure\n\n\n\n\n\n> Kicked out the foreigners  #KeepTheIsreaelitesPure  #PureJerusalem\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd in what must have felt like the ultimate victory for old Nehemiah:\n\n\n\n\n\n> I chased @Jehoidia son-in-law of @SanballatTheHoronite away! He is gone from the city!\n\n\n\n\n\nTo which I now might imagine a response out of the future:\n\n\n\n\n\n> From @JCSofG,   Wait, What!? No No No!  #EatWithTaxCollectorsAndSinners!  #BadNehemia\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, does our story for today all come down to Nehemiah getting his revenge on the Ammonites for trying to thwart his efforts to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem?  It sure sounds like it. The sad thing is that In many ways this story seems all too familiar.  Take out Nehemiah and Insert the name of your favorite ruler: \n\n\n\n\n\n   * Humble beginnings\n\n   * Great accomplishments and rise to power\n\n   * Power goes to the head\n\n   * Stupid policies\n\n\n\nWhats maybe more interesting to me is why this particular verse is the verse for the day, with all of the good things Nehemiah did, why highlight this one idiotic policy? Maybe simply to remind us that tolerance is a good thing even when times are tough.  \n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time this last week trying to answer the question, where’s the grace in this story? I think maybe for us and for Nehemiah it really does come down to his final tweet:\n\n\n\n\n\n> Remember me @God for the good I have done!\n",

				"content_text": "\n<p>Today I'm really pleased to announce that  have launched version 2.0 of our interactive computer science  textbooks:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/thinkcspy/index.html\">How to Think Like a Computer Scientist:  Interactive Edition 2.0</a>  (CS 1)</li>\n\n<li><a href=\"http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html\">Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python</a>  (CS 2)</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>We first launched these books on our <a href=\"http://interactivepython.org\">interactivepython.org</a> website in May of 2012, after around a year of private testing in the classroom.  Since then we have had 1.3 million page views by a quarter of a million unique visitors.  Daily, we get around 2,000 unique visitors.  Not bad for a site with zero dollars for an advertising budget.</p>\n\n<h2>What Makes these Books Unique?</h2>\n\n<p>These books are unique because they are interactive.  We have developed a set of authoring tools that make it really easy to write an interactive textbook with many interactive features.  We call these the Runestone tools.  Some of the interactive features that are possible include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Activecode</strong>:  Using a <a href=\"http://skulpt.org\">Javascript implementation</a> of Python you can run and modify the examples in the textbook right in the book.  No server connection is required since it is based on javascript and runs right in the browser.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Codelens</strong>:  Using the amazing power of the <a href=\"http://www.pythontutor.com\">pythontutor.com</a>  tools you can step through examples one line at a time, forward and backward.  While you are stepping through the code you can see variables and other data structures change values.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Parsons Problems: </strong> For beginning programmers Parson's problems are like refrigerator magnet poetry.  You can provide your students with the statements needed to write a program, but they must put the statements in the correct order.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Inline Quizzes: </strong>Each section of the book contains some inline quizzes that allow students to check their understanding of the material.  The quizzes have different feedback for each correct or incorrect answer that try to point students in the right direction. </li>\n\n<li><strong>Online Homework:</strong>   At the end of each chapter are programming assignments.  In this new edition we have provided the answers to the odd numbered questions, and discussion forums for students to exchange ideas or ask questions about the homework problems.  As an instructor, you can grade your students programs on one convenient page.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Highlighting</strong>  This is another much requested new feature.  Students can highlight text using the mouse and the highlights magically reappear on any supported browser.  In addition we will remember the students last location in the book and offer to return them to that position when they return.</li>\n\n<li>There are many other features but the best way to understand what we are doing is to actually have a look at our <a href=\"http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/overview/overview.html\">overview page</a>, which shows everything I have mentioned here and a lot more in action.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p>Over this past year we have discovered that we serve two different audiences with these books.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Instructors looking for a textbook to use in their own course</li>\n\n<li>People who are interested in teaching themselves some computer science and have found our books through google search, the Python wiki, or some other word of mouth source.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Textbooks as a Service</h2>\n\n<p>When we launched the site last year we decided to not only provide the books free and open for anyone who wanted to read them, but also as a service for instructors who wanted to have their own custom copy of the book where they could track their students progress, review their answers to quizzes, and grade their students homework.   If you want to use our books in your class you are welcome to do so.  You have two options:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\n<li>You can use a copy of either book as is with the order of the chapters just as they are on the books linked to above.</li>\n\n<li>You can try our custom interface where you can mix and match chapters from both books to create your own custom textbook.</li>\n\n</ol>\n\n<p>Once you have created your own course then you will be able to see the assignments your students have completed right in the textbook.  I find this to be very valuable as an instructor.  For example if I have assigned the students to read and do the quizzes for a particular section, I can simply go to the quiz question and click on the 'Compare Me' button.  As an instructor I will see a summary of the answers my students gave, as well as the details of the answers that each student tried.</p>\n\n<h2>Supporting the Independent Learner</h2>\n\n<p>Perhaps the biggest surprise of this project is the number of people that have found one of the books through google, and are simply teaching themselves to program.  We are hopeful that some of the new features we have added will help foster a  community of learners so that people just learning to program can talk to others in the same situation.  Some things we hope are particularly helpful include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li><strong>Answers to odd numbered questions</strong>.  This was probably the number one request I got through email all last year.  How do I know if I did it right?  We decided to risk it and provide the answers, but only to the odd numbered problems.  In addition a student must try to answer the problem at least once before the answer becomes \"unlocked\"</li>\n\n<li><strong>Discussion threads</strong> for homework problems.  Again this may seem like a risky move where students can just publish their answer and others can copy.  But, what we are hoping for is that students will see that there are many ways to get to the \"right answer\"  There are different approaches and programming styles that can be used to solve the same problem.</li>\n\n<li><strong>Compare Me</strong>  Although we aren't sure about the title on the button, the idea is that after answering one of the quiz questions a learner can check on their overall 'grade' for all quiz questions, and see how their answer compared to all the other learners.  We haven't gone so far as to give out badges, but we think this is a nice intermediate approach.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2>The Runestone Tools</h2>\n\n<p>The books above were built using our <a href=\"http://runestoneinteractive.org\">Runestone Interactive</a> toolkit.  These tools are freely available on <a href=\"http://github.com/bnmnetp/runestone\">github</a>.  If you want to write your own interactive book, or even just use the tools to create some interactive labs for your students you are welcome to do so.  You can write your materials in an easy to use markup language called restructuredText and add examples or quizzes using very simple tags.  Complete documentation for our extensions to restructuredText is provided on the website.  In addition to our own books, the team at Harvey Mudd College has published <a href=\"http://www.cs.hmc.edu/csforall\">CS for All</a>  another introductory textbook using our tools.  I know of at least two other books in progress!  </p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in following our development or getting involved You can do so in several ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>Twitter, follow <a

href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/runestoneinteractive\">Groups</a>  </li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>\n\n<p>I am grateful to the many people who have provided us with feedback over the last year.  And I am especially grateful to the ACM SIGCSE social projects committee for providing me with a special projects grant that allowed me to work with a student (Isaac Dontje Lindell) this summer.  He did a ton of work and will be graduating next year.  You should hire him.  In addition this project relies on many open source components which I will mention and link to below.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\n<li>The original text for<em> How to Think Like a Computer Scientist</em> comes from Allen Downey, Jeff Elkner and Chris Meyers.  We have modified it a lot, but without a starting point for us to experiment with our interactive ideas this project never would have taken off.</li>\n\n<li>The <em>Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures</em> text is published as a paper textbook by Franklin Beedle and Associates.  Without the forward thinking of Jim Leisy this book would be stuck.  Thankfully Jim freed us to use the text in an interactive form online.</li>\n\n<li>Mark Guzdial, Barbara Ericson and the rest of the <a href=\"http://home.cc.gatech.edu/csl/CSLearning4U\">CSLearning4U</a> research group at Georgia Tech have provided questions,

Although the filming took several hours, we got less than 1 second of screen time.  But here we are!  Brian and I happened to be in a pretty good spot as the camera flashes past us several times.

I do remember really liking Sheldon's lettuce cups as well as Stefan's little potato soup cup.  I could swear that I remember seeing Kristin on the ship, so maybe she got to come along since she would be competing in last chance kitchen in Juneau. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now I'm looking forward to the finale.  I'm not sure who I want to win the most, with Stefan and Josie gone all the villains are off the show.  I think it would be awesome if Kristin makes it through LCK and gets to compete against Sheldon or Josh in the Finale.  Thats Josh, by the way, in the first photo.</p>\n",

Talk about a ski pass that appeals to the Geek in me!  But whats even better is that every time you go on a lift, there is an RFID reader that grabs your ID and logs that lift ride.  So now at the end of the day you can go on to a website and see how many vertical feet you skiied that day.  Very cool.  Over our four days of skiing we did just over 95,000 vertical feet!  If we'd only known how close to 100k we would get we surely would have had a shorter lunch break on day one!</p>\n\n<p>Since snow started late and has been a bit sparse since Christmas there was a lot of snow making going on.

				"content_html": "<p>I mentioned type 3 fun in a previous posting, and although there was plenty of type 1 fun to be had in Icy Strait I&rsquo;d like to begin this post with a little description of some type 3 fun.  As a reminder, the definition of type 3 fun is something that is lame when you do it, and remains lame and not fun even in the retelling.  Thus was our bike tour of Hoonah.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I should start out by saying that it is not the fault of the bike tour guide, or anyone else involved with tours at Icy Straits.  We signed up for the bike tour / zip line combination tour through the cruise line because that was the only way we could sign up for a zip line tour in the afternoon.  The idea of an eight mile bike ride sounded appealing, a bike tour is a great way to see an area at a faster pace than walking, and is a nice way to get to know an area better than you do in a tour bus.  but, the simple truth is that Hoonah is a nice small fishing town in Alaska, but there really isn&rsquo;t that much to see.  So, we saw the ferry terminal (3-4 ferries per week), the office bar, the seaplane dock, the library, the post office, and the airport.  Oh yeah, and it was RAINING yes  really really raining.  We were absolutely soaked to the bone through our pants and jackets and everything.  Yuck!  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We all agreed that what we should have done was just not ride the bikes.  We could have stayed at the visitor center for a while staying warm and dry and then gotten on the bus to the top of the zip line.  Our mistake.  So, yes a wet cold bike ride through a town of 800 is virtually the definition of type 3 fun.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But, lets leave that in the past and talk about the highlights of our day in Icy Strait.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It began in the morning with our whale watching adventure.  We had booked a small tour with a private operator.   I would highly recommend that everyone does this.  The small boats are so much more nimble, and you get to know some of the local people in a way that you can&rsquo;t when you are on a big boat with 100 other people.   So it happened that there were only six of us on the boat with captain Floyd.  We had plenty of room to spread out and we were not vying for position with other people when the whales showed up.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As whale watching trips go, this one just couldn&rsquo;t be beat.  We were not even out of the harbor before we were treated to a humpback bubble netting.  Bubble netting is one feeding strategy used by the humpacks.  They circle under the water making tons of bubbles that confuse the smelt to the point where they don&rsquo;t know which way is up.  Then the whale swoops in from below with mouth wide open and scoops up hundreds of gallons of water and fish.  The whale closes its mouth and strains out all the yummy fish through its baleen.  Here&rsquo;s a picture of the first whale we encountered.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, of course, anyone who has ever been on a whale watching trip has seen lots of whale tails.  As the humpbacks typically come up, show their hump for a while, and then dive deep.  When they dive deep they do so with their tail straight up in the air.  What most people do not get the opportunity to see first hand is a humpback breaching.  This is when the whale propels its whole body out of the water.  This is an amazing feet for an animal that averages 40 feet in length and weighs about 1000 pounds per foot of length!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We were lucky enough to see several such breaches.  I was lucky enough to have my camera pointed in the right direction when this one happened!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, we were in for one more bonus.  Orcas!  Its pretty rare to get to see Orcas on a whale watching trip!  After watching the humpbacks for a while our captain informed us that there were Orcas in the area.  This is another great example of the benefit of going on a smaller ship.  The captain can just take off and follow the whales you want to see.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here are two Orcas from the small pod we were following.  For a while we thought we were going to see the death of one of the sea lions swimming perilously close to this group, but I guess they were not hungry at the time.  The dorsal fin in the picture above is about six feet tall!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, the whale watching was awesome, but our final act of the day was also a  real blast.  The worlds longest, highest, fastest zip line!  Its a one shot ride from the top of the mountain outside of hoonah, down to sea level.  This was  really a stretch for Holly, who is a not a lover of heights, but the ride was fun.  Unlike other zip lines, this one actually has a harness that allows you to sit quite comfortably.  You don&rsquo;t have any brakes to worry about as that is taken care of for you at the bottom by Physics.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the top of the zip line you brace your feet against the starting gate, six people at a time, and then they count down from three.  The gates open and you are off.  In our case we started out in the clouds, flying downward.  Suddenly you are out of the clouds and the ship and the water all come into beautiful view right in front of your eyes.  In just about 90 seconds the ride is over, but its a real thrill.  I&rsquo;ve got some great video from the head mounted camera, but I&rsquo;ll have to wait until I get home to edit that and post it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hoonah, AK<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

This is an amazing feet for an animal that averages 40 feet in length and weighs about 1000 pounds per foot of length!<br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/116433235603763796408/InstantUpload#5772201228003321314'><img src='https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5343eda9c9.jpg' border='0' width='400' height='400' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />We were lucky enough to see several such breaches.  I was lucky enough to have my camera pointed in the right direction when this one happened!<br /><br />Finally, we were in for one more bonus.  Orcas!  Its pretty rare to get to see Orcas on a whale watching trip!  After watching the humpbacks for a while our captain informed us that there were Orcas in the area.  This is another great example of the benefit of going on a smaller ship.  The captain can just take off and follow the whales you want to see.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='https://picasaweb.google.com/116433235603763796408/InstantUpload#5772201284964585906'><img src='https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6fdf2fee32.jpg' border='0' width='400' height='400' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />Here are two Orcas from the small pod we were following.  For a while we thought we were going to see the death of one of the sea lions swimming perilously close to this group, but I guess they were not hungry at the time.  The dorsal fin in the picture above is about six feet tall!<br /><br />So, the whale watching was awesome, but our final act of the day was also a  real blast.  The worlds longest, highest, fastest zip line!  Its a one shot ride from the top of the mountain outside of hoonah, down to sea level.  This was  really a stretch for Holly, who is a not a lover of heights, but the ride was fun.  Unlike other zip lines, this one actually has a harness that allows you to sit quite comfortably.  You don't have any brakes to worry about as that is taken care of for you at the bottom by Physics.<br /><br />At the top of the zip line you brace your feet against the starting gate, six people at a time, and then they count down from three.  The gates open and you are off.  In our case we started out in the clouds, flying downward.  Suddenly you are out of the clouds and the ship and the water all come into beautiful view right in front of your eyes.  In just about 90 seconds the ride is over, but its a real thrill.  I've got some great video from the head mounted camera, but I'll have to wait until I get home to edit that and post it.<br /><br /><br /><br />- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad<br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Hoonah,%20AK&z=10'>Hoonah, AK</a></p>\n",

We were in our Alaskan layers of Dry Fit, Kuhl Fleece, and North Face.  To this we added rain pants and a rain jacket.  There was a light rain falling at the beginning of our hike, but that stopped somewhere along the way.

This was really a blast even though it was just a short little climb to get the hang of it.  Ice climbing involves driving your crampons straight into the ice wall, while hanging from two pick axes.  Of course we had a safety line so we wouldn&rsquo;t fall, if we lost our grip.  It was really fun but took a lot of effort.

He took us over to the side of the glacier where we took off our crampons and hiked down to a spot where there was a cave.  We hiked right inside the glacier.  There was a little stream flowing into the glacier, and the ice was really amazing.  Overhead the ice was glowing blue from the light filtering in from above.  On the sides it looked like polished metal, which was because the ice was dirty and there was no light coming in from that direction.

				"content_text": "\n<p>After hosting the interactive edition of How to Think like a Computer Scientist on the Google app engine at thinkcspy.appspot.com for over a year, we finally made the switchover to a new domain.  As of today all requests to thinkcspy will be automatically redirected to <a href=\"http://interactivepython.org\">http://interactivepython.org</a></p>\n\n<p>This new domain, is hosted by Webfaction.com.  They have very reasonable hosting rates, along with plenty of bandwidth and disk space.   I have more control over the development platform that I use, I get to keep my data in a real relational database (postgresql) where I can write queries and export my data as much as I want, and finally, if I ever need to move from Webfaction, I own the domain and can move it with me, and I won't need to go through this name change again.</p>\n\n<p>For those of you who have used the thinkcspy site, you will notice a few upgrades to the content of the book have taken place.  In addition, we are now hosting another book along side thinkcspy.  So we now have coverage for both CS1 and CS2.</p>\n\n<p>CS1 -- <a href=\"http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/index.html\">http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/index.html</a>  </p>\n\n<p>CS2 --<a href=\"http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/index.html\"> http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/pythonds/index.html</a>  </p>\n\n<p>The CS2 book is based on our paperback book, Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python by Brad Miller and David Ranum.  Our forward thinking publisher has given us permission to convert the paper book into an interactive version and make it available online!</p>\n\n<p>The other great thing about the move to interactivepython.org is that you can now host your own course.  That is you can use one of our books online, but you are the instructor, so you can grade homework assignments, and look at activity reports for the students in your class.  So far we have 20 different institutions hosting one of the two books for a course currently,  or for the upcoming fall term.  The links to create your own course are right there on the home page, so if you are interested in using this site for a course go right ahead.</p>\n\n<p>The one downside to this move is that I did not migrate any of the data from the old thinkcspy site.  So if you have saved programs there you will need to recreate them at the new site.  I gave people plenty of notice about the move, so I'm hoping this won't turn into a big issue.  If it is, let me know, and I'll try to pull your code out of the google datastore for you.</p>\n\n<p>The second issue with the move is that I don't use google accounts  anymore.  If you want to save your programs you will need to create an account on the site.</p>\n\n<p>If you have a link to thinkcspy.appspot.com on any pages you control, please make the change to point to the new domain and location.  Thanks!</p>\n\n<p>If you are interested in contributing to the project, have a book you would like to host, or are just interested in how we are doing this, you can check out the code on github:  [github.com/bnmnetp/r...](http://github.com/bnmnetp/runestone)   If you don't want to go that far, but have assignments, or assessment questions you would like to contribute, please contact me!</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n",

The middle of Etosha, the middle of the desert, Each of which would be hours and hours from anywhere likely to have the ability to come and get us.  We'll be just fine, and this answers the important question of what to write about in today's blog.</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE:  We're moving again, in a lovely, highly air conditioned coach.  Its just 2:55 so we were only delayed about 1:45.  When the replacement bus got here we formed a bucket brigade and transferred the luggage from one to the other in no time.  We're looking forward to arriving at the Safari and we'll still have some time to relax and refresh before we go to our dinner at Nampa and Matty's house.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>If someone had told me six months ago that in the span of 24 hours I would see nine Lions,  two Rhino, four Elephants, three Hyena, one Jackal, a Journey of Giraffe, a Dazzle of Zebra, and countless Wildebeest, Springbok, Oryx, and Impala I would never have thought it possible.  But that is exactly what happened this last day.  As Ann remarked, \"whoever thought I would be so casual about seeing another Zebra\"</p>\n\n<p>On the drive into the park we got really excited about seeing  a couple of Elephants and Giraffe in the distance, then Joey pulled off onto one of the many side roads that takes you to a water hole and we were able to get a little closer.  But later we were to find out that that initial excitement was just an appetizer.  A couple of water holes down the road, we pulled up and there were two huge elephants just standing 20 yards from the bus.  And the Giraffe seemed to be everywhere along the side of the road.  It was really incredible to get so close to all of the animals.</p>\n\n<p>We stopped for a late lunch and then walked to the water hole at the Na… Rest Camp, someone had sited another elephant and it looked like we could get close to this one standing on the observation platform.  However when I got out there it had disappeared into the bush.  I had turned around and was headed back toward the bus when Josh Martin softly called me back -- \"Rihno!\"  I got back but the Rhino had wandered into the trees so I was only able to get a partial shot of it with my camera.  I have a great 70-200mm zoom, but I was now wishing I had upgraded to the new 100-300 model!</p>\n\n<p>When we got to our rest camp we were all planning to sign up for an open air Jeep excursion.  It was a little confusing, but our options were to go out at 5:30AM, midday, or an evening excursion starting at 18:30.  I don't think any of us was particularly excited about getting up for another early morning drive, so lots of conversation ensued.  In the end we all booked the 5:30AM tour and were not disappointed.  Remember that we are in Africa, so even though the days are long in the Northern Hemisphere we are at some of the shortest days here.  At 5:30 it was still completely dark.  However we were treated to a spectacular view of Venus and Mars.  Our guide and driver for the morning was named Samuel, he's been working in the park for 20 years and does an amazing job of spotting the game.  We told him that we really wanted to see some cats and he smiled and told us that what you see on any given day is mostly luck.</p>\n\n<p>We drove for quite a while in the dark with Samuel illuminating our path with a red handheld light.  It was COLD, we all had on many layers including winter coats, and luckily Samuel provided us with ponchos to put over our legs for another layer of warmth.  We never really did see anything in the dark.  At the first water hole we stopped we didn't see anything so we drove around to the other side of the water hole where Samuel said 'Lion!'  We looked and at first none of us could see it, but eventually we all saw what he was pointing to.  A male lion laying down at the edge of the water hole munching on something that was freshly killed.  As I was watching the lion through my long lens I noticed something much darker pop up from the grass behind the lion.  Samuel confirmed that it was a Hyena, in fact there are probably several of them waiting for their chance to eat whatever the lion leaves behind.  We also discovered that there was another lion that had been lying a few meters away from the first.  We were just starting to pull away when we were rewarded with a final view of the Lion who stood up and took a big stretch.</p>\n\n<p>We drove on through herds of Zebra and all kinds of antelope when Samuel spotted another pair of Lions just on the edge of the pan, these were farther away than the first but the light was much better so I was able to get some good pictures and really zoom in on these.  In fact it turned out that there were seven Lion in this area, and Samuel said probably two more that we didn't see, because the pride is eleven, and we had already seen two of them at the previous water hole.  The drama of seeing this group of Lions was heightened by one lonesome and apparently suicidal Springbok.  This poor creature seemed completely unaware of the Lions and just kept wandering closer and closer.  Samuel said that Lions only strike if they know they won't have to chase their prey for more than 100 meters, but would could see the lions get very still and very low to the ground, they clearly had not missed this Springbok.  Eventually the little guy came to his senses and escaped with his life, at least for today.</p>\n\n<p>When we got back from the drive we went to breakfast and we have spent the rest of the day sitting and observing at the water hole, or lying around the pool area soaking up some of the warm midday and afternoon sun.  We are hoping for a return of the Rhinos that appeared here last night, but as Samuel said its mostly luck as to what might show up on any given day.</p>\n\n<p>And just as I finished writing those words we were rewarded.  A giraffe came ever so slowly and cautiously out of the trees to get a drink.  This is a really amazing process.  First she approaches the water hole very slowly, checking each way several times.  Then she must get in position to drink, which involves spreading her legs very wide  so her neck can reach the water, but you can tell this puts the giraffe in a very vulnerable position so much stopping and starting and looking around ensues as she prepares to drink.  And when she does its a long one.  Twenty seconds maybe with the mouth in the water, and then with a mighty shake she raises her body up and assumes a position that looks like she's ready to flee.  With all of us sitting up here taking pictures and whispering she is very cautious of us.  What a site, this whole trip to the water hole probably took just over an hour between her cautious approach to the hole and then multiple long approaches and drinks.  Patience is a virtue.</p>\n",

Hanock Kindergarden.</p>\n\n<p>This 'school' was a metal building that was a maximum of 12 feet by 12 feet and barely tall enough for Josh Martin to stand in.  This school housed 24 students, about half of which had chairs to sit in.  The students were prepared for us to come, and gave us a concert and a number of demonstrations of their ability to count, and name the colors and the shapes.  It was really impressive and they were all so eager to show off their knowledge.  From the very beginning they instill in these learners the importance of knowledge and going to school. \"Knowledge is our future\" they sing.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to this small classroom there are outhouse facilities donated by Luther alums Orv and Cathy Johnson. The Luther connections here in Namibia are many and strong.  It is almost heartbreaking to see what a relatively small amount of money by American standards can accomplish over here.  We left the kindergarden some blocks and a soccer ball.  The look on the children's faces when they emerged from the building to kick the ball around was another of those moments that make you realize what this trip is all about.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>Here we are back on the bus after a stop at the woodcarvers market all of us laughing our heads off.  About 70km North of Windhoek we stopped at the woodcarvers market.  In my mind I had a vision of a sedate little market where Namibian men were sitting and carving interesting wooden masks and bowls.  What ensued was the first \"holy shit\" comment of the day from one of our co-travellers.  While Jane went across the road to the market, I went to the coffee shop to get some coffee.  As Josh and I crossed the road I was approached my a young man who said \"I have your wife\"  A swarm of young men descended on us, come to my shop, come to my shop, the next 20 minutes were pure chaos of bargaining in both US$ and Namibian $.</p>\n\n<p>Now that the dust has settled a bit it appears that the best strategy is to offer somewhere less than half of what they first tell you is the price and work your way up as slowly as you can.  However, we all learned that the hard way.  Our first purchase of this manic shopping spree was a marble bowl.  The asking price was N$650, we countered with N$400 and settled at N$500.  Way to high.  As Jane was literally pulled out of that shop and on to another shop I saw an elephant hair bracelet.  I didn't have any Namibian dollars left so I told him I would buy it with US$.  He said $70 US for the bracelet.  I told him no way; but by then the bracelet was already on my arm.  So I told him the leather bracelet I had cost less than $20 he said make me an offer, so I told him $10.  But its made from Elephant hair!!  With that he wrote $50 on his arm.  No way, I said so I came up to $15.  Eventually we settled at $20.  I really do this is one of the best deals I've ever made.</p>\n\n<p>As all of this was taking place young men were trying to lure Mary (Ethan's mom) to the outskirts of their little woodcarving village.  Mary resisted with the help of her sister Carol who exclaimed, \"I'm not letting you get sold into white slavery\"  Mary was the smartest among us as all she purchased was a single woven basket.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Jane was embroiled in making a bargain for a couple of giraffes.  We were rapidly running out of cash, and she was desperately trying to get back to the first stall where she had found a bowl she really liked.  We ended up with the giraffes and two bowls.  Now this young man grabbed the bowls and told us he'd wrap them for us.  As he was wrapping them he insisted that Jane look at the Salad tongs in his stall.  He proceeded to hold our bowls hostage until Jane finally bought two sets for US$10.  Meanwhile Josh was standing outside the stall saying Mom, we have to go, the bus is going to leave.  Apparently this is a common ploy as one young man was stuffing marble candle holders into Jerry's backpack.  Ann had to pull them out and pull Jerry out of the stall in order to escape.</p>\n\n<p>Jane is now trying to sell two of the salad tongs she bought to Josh Martin.  She told him she'd sell him the one pair for $20 US.  Just think of your mother she said!  If you brought these home to her she'd know you were thinking about her.  So, Karen, if you want some Namibian salad tongs just let us know, we'll make you a really good deal!</p>\n\n<p>I think at the end of the session we had spent about $100 US, or 800 Namibian dollars.  Even if we overpaid for every item it was well worth the price just for the experience.  Plus we figure we are helping these guys make their living and propping up the economy of Okahandja.  Josh Miller and Josh Martin were the only two people who didn't spend any money.  Josh had 20 people approach him, and he just kept telling them, I don't have any money. I don't have any money. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n",

There is lots of work to do before we can claim success here, but I think we have a good vision and a decent start.</li>&#13;\n\n<li>A model for a new online only publishing house. At some point, I think it is important for content to go through an editorial process, not just for copy editing quality, but for coherence, and quality of approach. Right now the number of content creators using our system is pretty small, but I can already see that starting to grow. We have lots of thinking to do about this.</li>&#13;\n\n<li>A home for hosting online courses or textbooks.</li>&#13;\n\n</ol><h3>Who is your audience?</h3>&#13;\n\n<p>At the moment, I think we serve three distinct groups of people.</p>&#13;\n\n<ol><li>The  teacher out there who wants a good quality textbook, but is not interested in forcing their students to pay $100+ and is interesting in trying an interactive book, all for free.   So to serve this audience we have <a href=\"http://interactivepython.org\">interactvepython.org</a>. You can select one of our pre-defined books and set up a course where you are the instructor and have access to grading etc. Or you can use the drag-and-drop interface to put together a book by selecting from the library of modules. Maybe some of these teachers have an exercise or two they would like to contribute, but mostly they are just looking for good materials to help them with their course.</li>&#13;\n\n<li>Authors who would like to contribute significant chunks of content -- chapters or section sized -- or videos. For example I'm working with an entrepreneur who wants to add content and a graphics package that looks more like Nodebox. He's very interested in putting together materials for middle school kids.  Others, including other Computer Science researchers, are more interested in algorithm visualization and working together on building in more visualization tools to the tool box.  Others have their own CS course materials that they would like to get into an interactive form and make available to the world.</li>&#13;\n\n<li>People who are interested in learning CS on their own.  We get a ton of people coming to the site just to learn on their own. I had the most heartfelt letter from a guy the other day who found our site as he is trying to retool after being laid off for a couple of years. He said this is the first thing he's come across that really worked for him and helped him learn a bit of CS.  How does this compare with Udacity and Coursera?  Both of those companies are primarily video oriented, and both of those companies are running courses that are in some sense synchronous.  You have to move through the course on their schedule to get the full benefit.  Our books/courses can be done at your own pace, on your own time.</li>&#13;\n\n</ol><div> </div>&#13;\n\n<h3>I would like to use this for my own class how do I get started?</h3>&#13;\n\n<p>Its easy, just follow these steps:</p>&#13;\n\n<ol><li>Go to<a href=\"http://interactivepython.org\"> interactivepython.org</a> and register yourself as a user.</li>&#13;\n\n<li>Click on Create a Custom Course link in the right sidebar.</li>&#13;\n\n<li>Select a short name for your course that uniquely identifies it among all the other courses.</li>&#13;\n\n<li>Type in a short description for your course</li>&#13;\n\n<li>Now you get to choose.  Do you want to use one of our standard configurations, either How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition, or Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python  or do you want to build a custom book by choosing modules from both of the above?</li>&#13;\n\n<li>Click on the build button.  Wait a few minutes and you will have a page with a link to your new course.</li>&#13;\n\n</ol><div>Now you can send your students to interactivepython.org and simply tell them to register for your course.  </div>&#13;\n\n<div> </div>&#13;\n\n<div>Why would you choose to build your own course when you could just use one of the open books?  When you create your own course you become the instructor and admin for that course.  You can grade your students assignments right online, and even access their homework in progress if they have questions.  You can also get a sense for the different activities they are choosing to use in the textbook.</div>&#13;\n\n<h3>How can I get involved?</h3>&#13;\n\n<p>There are lots of ways you can get involved:</p>&#13;\n\n<ul><li>We need readers who are willing to be critical and report bugs on everything from typos to activecode blocks that don't work exactly right.</li>&#13;\n\n<li>We need web developers who are willing to work on the back end, developing reports for instructors and making sure our infrastructure is sound.</li>&#13;\n\n<li>We need web developers who are interested in developing user facing features, everything from algorithm visualizations to interactive assessment tools like the multiple choice and fill in the blank questions you see already.</li>&#13;\n\n<li>We need compiler geeks who can help fix bugs in our Javascript implementation of Python.</li>&#13;\n\n<li>We need authors who want to add new and interesting content, either entire courses, or new modules that could be combined with the modules already there.</li>&#13;\n\n</ul>\n",

I looked at too many of the following:</p>&#13;\n\n<ul><li>Google App Engine — I’m a long time GAE user, but the setup I have uses sphinx to generate content on the fly which it wants to store in pickle files on the local file system.  This doesn’t work with a GAE and some other systems that treat the file system as read only and expect any writing you do to go to a database.</li>&#13;\n\n<li>heroku — seems very promising, but I’m not sure how to configure web2py so it doesn’t need any local file system write access.  The lack of ssh access is a bit disconcerting.</li>&#13;\n\n<li>dotcloud — seems promising but the app kept hanging for no discernible reason.  I fought with it for the better part of the afternoon before deciding to move on.</li>&#13;\n\n<li>fluxflex — easy to get web2py installed, (1 minute)  but a real pain to try to work with a real app.  I’m not going to use the web interface for all my editing.  I want to git push and/or git pull to deploy and update the app.  It doesn’t seem possible to get both ease of installation and robust configuration management.</li>&#13;\n\n<li>pythonanywhere - non-starter</li>&#13;\n\n<li>webfaction — Its not free, but at least it has a command line I can work with and I’ve got the whole thing running.  The only confusing thing about webfaction is that they don’t list web2py as a supported framework, but when you type it in under other it magically works for  you….  The other annoying thing that I <em><strong>just</strong></em> discovered is that the 256MB limit is way too low for the default configuration.  I just now got a helpful email saying a support ticket had been opened for me because I was using too much memory.  This was like 15 minutes after I finally got my app running and I’d made about 5 page requests.</li>&#13;\n\n</ul> \n",

The views are fantastic.<br /><br />Iguazu back to BA and on to the ship!<br /><br />BA to Montevideo, Uruguay<br /><br />Montevideo to Punta del Este<br /><br />Punta del Este to Puerto Madryn -- Desert like climate but great penguins and sea lions.<br /><br />Puerto Madryn to Cape Horn and the Ushuaia (Ushuaia gets my vote for favorite city of the trip)  Its the southernmost city of the world, and the hiking and views on our hike in Tierra del Fuego national park were just phenomenal!<br /><br />Ushuaia to Punta Arenas... OK, but not that spectacular.  If you haven't seen penguins by now, you should definitely do the trip here to see the penguins.<br /><br />Punta Arenas to Puerto Montt.  The port area is not spectacular, but once you get out into the country or to one of the other smaller neighboring cities its great.  Beautiful scenery.... second favorite city.  Of course the zip line ride really made this stop worthwhile.<br /><br />Puerto Montt to Valparaiso to Santiago<br /><br />Santiago to Dallas<br /><br />Dallas to MSP<br /><br />Ride home with Sandy Larsen!  Wow gone 16 days and no parking charges at the airport!<br /><br />Other stuff:<br /><br />While on board, we used up 435 minutes of internet time.<br /><br />We drank 2 bottles of wine :-)  or more...<br /><br />Jane won $700 at the craps table<br /><br />We really enjoyed many of the shows onboard the Celebrity Infinity!  We had become pretty much jaded about cruise line entertainment, but the quality here was really high.  I missed having a magic show, but the music was mostly really great, except for the aging former Argentine star, who just doesn't realize its time to hang it up.  When you are on a cruise ship and you have to start your show with a video about how great you used to be, that is not a good sign!  Travis, from Nebraska, you rock.  The a cappella group top shelf was great too.  It was hard to listen to this recently graduated group of young guys without thinking about Kaia's future as a musical performer.<br /><br />No summary would be complete without some room pictures, so here are a few pics of our Celebrity Suite.  This suite will be redone when the ship is Solticized in November, but we thought it was perfect for this cruise.  Not only was the room spectacular, but our Butler, Teguh, was the most Amazing person.  No job was too big or too small, he really made our cruise seamless.  From sneaking into the room before I was awake every morning so that my coffee was hot and fresh on the table, to organizing a part for 20 in our room one night.  He was the best!<br /><br /><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/38a44df593.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 2543\" title=\"IMG_2543.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/a09407b670.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 2546\" title=\"IMG_2546.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bdfdd68ace.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 2556\" title=\"IMG_2556.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bdc38d1984.jpg\" alt=\"IMG 2549\" title=\"IMG_2549.jpg\" border=\"0\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /><br /><br />Jane says I can type and read at the airport tomorrow, so I think its time to get dressed for dinner one last time!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2808293707145995482?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>I've been back in Decorah for less than 24 hours, its been a little more than 48 hours since we got off the cruise ship in Valparaiso.  It was great to get a good nights sleep last night after having an overnight flight from Santiago to Dallas.  Boy do I wish I could sleep on airplanes.</p><p>The Celebrity debarkation process was about as painless as you could make it. We woke up, showered and dressed, got some coffee at the Cova Cafe, checked our email one last time, and then walked off the ship.  Like Buenos Aires, the port in Valparaiso is not really designed for cruise ships, so we got off the ship and then took a bus through the containers to the actual terminal.   We found our luggage right away and realized that this process was so efficient we still had about 45 minutes to wait before our guide, Mac, from <a href=\"http://www.labicicletaverde.com/\">La Bicicleta Verde</a> It was a little odd this morning because Chile was supposed to go off daylight savings time at the same time the US was supposed to go on daylight savings.  So, in one day we would go from being 3 hours ahead of home to just one hour.  Strangely the government of chile decided at the last minute not to go off daylight savings time, so some people were really off.  Mac showed up just after 9:00, and we got our tour underway.  We started by exploring the hills of Valparaiso.  Its an old shipping town, started when Nitrates were a big natural commodity that was shipped out of here.  Before the Canal, and before artificial nitrates had been invented.  So there are many beautiful old shipping houses owned by the british that have been converted into small hotels.  Here you can see one last view of our ship from the hills:</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2559.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c72024034e.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2559\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>We continued on past the first Lutheran Church in Valparaiso, and then had to avoid a pack of street dogs.  All chilean cities are full of street animals that are well feed and mostly well behaved.  The problem this morning was there was one female in heat and four males that were trying to get her attention.  Things got a little violent, so we headed off in the opposite direction hoping to lose the pack.</p><p>Mac told us that the day before this whole area of the city had been without power.  Now as you can see from this picture Valparaiso has a very modern system of electrical distribution:</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2566.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/dfcb38ce76.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2566\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>We were told that whenever there is a power loss, rather than trying to untangle the mass of wires and fix the problem, they simply find an area of the city that has power and then run a new wire to the blacked out area from there.</p><p>After the hill tour we headed down the coastline to visit some of the beautiful coastal towns, suchas Vina del Mar.  This would be an awesome place to come back and visit on a land tour.  The beaches are spectacular, and there are some really awesome restaurants looking right out over the water.  Mac got us number one at the most popular restaurant along this stretch.  People literally line up outside this restaurant waiting for a table.  Something that is unheard of in Chile.  We started off with a couple of apetizers:  Machas ala parmesan (razor clams smothered in a parmesan cream sauce.)  The only way to sum up this dish is:  To Die For!  We also had Camerones pil pil (little shrimp scampi).  Then for the main course we had freshly prepared fish.  They have about 7 different kinds of fish on the menu, each one with several different preparations.  I had Albacora (swordfish) grilled, and Jane had the Corvina (chilean sea bass) also grilled.  We had a side of Arroz and thought we were in heaven.  What a great last meal of the trip.  Oh, lest I forget , I also had my first Pisco Sour.  Pisco Sour is a great chilean drink made of a distilled wine (kind of like brandy) served with lime juice and simple syrup.  Just one please!</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2569.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/64d99b9b22.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2569\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>After our delicious lunch we headed out to wine country.  The Casablanca valley is between Valparaiso and Santiago.  We stopped at the Emiliana Organic Vineyards, for a wine tasting and a walk around the vineyards.  We had a great wine steward, named Joshua, who served us samples of their premium Emiliana Adobe line.  This is sold in the United States under the Emiliana Natura label because of  a trademark dispute with the Adobe software company.  Please lawyers find something more productive to do with your time.  The highlight was their Gewurtztraminer, its not nearly as sweet as the German Gewurtztraminers and was very refreshing.  In addition to being organic they also practice Biodynamics (you'll have to look it up).  This sounds like a lot of hokum to me, but you can't argue with the results.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2574.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6600536ef4.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2574\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>Finally, what trip would be complete without some cute animals.  The vineyard also raises Alpacas, which we learned are part of the Camel family.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2585.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2f30b88b83.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2585\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>With the vineyard tour over, our last stop was the Santiago airport.  We had lots of time to kill, since we got there about 5pm and our flight wasn't supposed to leave until 10:05.  Of course at 5:00 the American Airlines counters were not even open yet. Then at 6:00 when they opened it was a mad house.  hundreds of tired cruisers all anxious to get home, and all accustomed to being pampered for two weeks were now forced to stand in extremely long lines like so many commoners.  It was not pretty.  An interesting thing about flying out of Santiago is that all the outgoing flights leave in the evening, this is partly because you want to time your flight to get in to the states at a decent hour of the morning.  Say 6:00 AM or so.  But all the incoming flights get in to Santiago at 7 or 8 in the morning anyway, so why not have an outbound flight at 10AM?  By Chilean law, all outbound flights must have a complete mechanical inspection within 12 hours of their flight by a Chilean mechanical team.  The reason for this law dates back to 1972 when the Uruguayan rugby team crashed in the Andes and resorted to cannibalism to stay alive.  The Chilean legislature wanted to ensure that nothing like this would ever happen again so they passed this inspection law.  The result is that the flights that leave in the evening are never delayed for mechanical reasons, because they've had all day to inspect and fix everything.  Nice, makes you feel safe.</p><p>Well, that brings us as far as our last flights, which were pretty uneventful.  A bit of turbulence somewhere between Santiago and Dallas is about the only thing worth mentioning.  This was an awesome trip.  Thanks again to all the great new friends we made on board the ship for making it a fun time!</p><p> </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-570044920896128868?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>This is weird, but I woke up this morning wondering about the question:  \"what are the ships procedures in case of a Tsunami?\"  Would we head for the open sea and ride out the giant fast moving swell there, or would we seek safe haven in a harbor of some kind.  Then, when Jane checked her email and the news she told me about the 8.9 magnitude earthquake in Japan, and the Tsunami warning issued for the entire Pacific Ocean.  I didn't really give it much thought, because after all we are a LONG way away from Japan.  However, when we were in the tour bus this morning, our guide told us that they were evacuating Easter Island and some of the other Chilean Islands.  OK, maybe this is more serious than we thought.  Now I was thinking what kind of damage could be done to the harbor in Valparaiso?  Will the tsunami have an impact on our trip home?  When we returned from touring we noticed that they were essentially evacuating the harbor, all of the ships we already towed out or in the process of being moved out of the harbor to more open water.  Score one for the open water solution.</p><p>As far as we know, this is not going to have a big impact on our trip. Out at sea, the tsunami is nothing but a big swell that we would ride up and over like any other large swell.  Its only when it gets toward land that it becomes the giant wall of water you see on the news. The captain is going about business as usual and we are on our way out of the harbor at Puerto Montt as I write this.  We have about 650 nautical miles from here to Valparaiso, and tomorrow we will spend a relaxing last day at sea.  If we were the tsunami, we would be able to get there in just a little over an hour!  According to news reports the wave traveled from japan toward Hawaii and the west coast of the US at over 500 mph.  The pictures of Japan on the news are just unbelievable, but again it appears that distance will sufficiently weaken the tsunami to the point where we will not be affected at all.</p><p>So, lets turn our attention to our fabulous day here in Puerto Montt!  We got to check off a bucket list item today.  What could that be you ask?   Zip Lining!  The highlight of todays tour was going to the top of a volcano, and then riding a series of zip lines to the bottom.  When we arrived on the pier this morning it was quite overcast and the owner of the tour company warned us that with the rain from last night and the wind today we might be out of luck.  But we took off in our little bus and headed for Lago Llanguihue, this is a huge vacation lake that sits below the volcanoes.  And when we arrived at the base of the ski lift on the volcano it appeared that we might in fact be out of luck.  Here's a view of what the side of the volcano/ski area looked like:</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2473.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ac6963a60a.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2473\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>We were clearly in and above the cloud line, and it was really eerie to see the wisps of clouds, that looked like steam rising from the dark sides of the volcano.  Our guide told us that we would not be allowed to go because of the wind.  So, we just hung out for a while looking at the clouds and suddenly we noticed that the sky towards the top was starting to clear.  Suddenly the chair lift even started running.  Our guide came out and said OK team lets head down and we'll go into Puerto Vargassafsf for some shopping and a nice lunch.  Wait!  a couple of the women (including jane) said.  Can't we at least ride up the chair lift?  Of course I'm thinking you guys are mad, why would we want to ride higher up into the clouds to just see more clouds.  So our guide told us to wait and she would check.  Miraculously, now the 'experts' were out checking the zip lines to see if they were safe.  The verdict came back that it was safe, so a few of us decided to follow the original plan and go for it.</p><p>When we reached the top of the ski lift we were treated to the following view:</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2496.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/d785740e22.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2496\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>Clearly you can see the clouds had dissipated and we had a fantastic view of the top of the volcano, and its glacier.  It took us a few minutes, as the guy working at the top of the lift did not speak any english, but we eventually located our zip lining guides.  They got us into our harnesses and led us to the top of the launching pad for our very brief (10 seconds?) safety briefing.</p><p>Him:   hold</p><p>Me:  Si</p><p>Him:  break</p><p>Me: Si</p><p>Him:  No touch the cable, only here and the break</p><p>Me:  Si</p><p>And off you go!</p><p>Here's Jane and our friend Scott before we got our helmets.  Those harnesses are certainly stylish.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2484.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cdf80848a0.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2484\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>And now here's Jane on her first run of the day.  Yes kids thats your mother hanging by a thread from a long thin piece of cable..  Don't worry she's having the time of her life.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2486.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bfc7027f23.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2486\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p> </p><p>And now here's one of me coming in for a landing after our longest ride.  The span of this ride was 600 meters!  The total ride time was about 38 seconds which means our average speed was 15.78 meters/second or about 35 mph.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2519.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f1aeb010f2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2519\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>In all, we got to go on four different runs, each was great and very exhilarating.  We had an adrenaline rush for a good hour after we were all done, talking excitedly in the bus all the way back down the volcano.  A great day and a lot of fun.  Can't wait to try it again sometime!</p><p> </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-4524677153241371099?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>We are sitting here having our morning coffee and hot chocolate watching the waves crash and roll.  We left the Straits of Magellan sometime in the middle of the night and entered the Pacific Ocean, where we have high winds and, as the captain says, \"Big Waves.\"  I took some video looking out our window, but I'm not sure you can get the real sense of how much we are rocking and rolling.  I'll post the video when we have a faster internet connection.  Meanwhile I just walked down the stairs to the Cova Cafe to get some of their great little croissants for breakfast, and I noticed that the crew has strategically placed barf bags along the stairwells and in other places.  According to the captain, who just updated us, we are experiencing winds at 50-60 knots with gusts of 70 knots.  In addition the waves are 15-20 feet high.</p><p>I just got back from the workout room.  walking up the stairs was quite an adventure.  At times I felt like I was floating up two to three stairs at a time, and at other times, I felt like I was carrying an elephant on my back as I was trying to go up a single stair.  Bootcamp was postponed this morning due to the high seas.  I decided to go ahead on run on the elliptical, which was kind of fun with all the dipping and plunging the ship was doing.</p><p>We will be at sea today, and tomorrow, although later today and all of tomorrow we will be cruising through the Chilean Fjords. The Fjords will be much calmer than the open ocean.  I'm not sure whether or not to even attempt to go to bootcamp workout in these high waves.</p><p>Yesterday we were in Punta Arenas.  It was our first stop in Chile.  We did not do any kind of excursion or tour.  We just took the tender to shore and walked around the town a bit.  There was a nice park square with trees, and a statue of Magellan, and handicrafts.  Apparently you are supposed to kiss the toe of Magellan and you will come back again, but with the crew having you sanitize your hands every five minutes, I can't imagine why anyone would want to kiss the toe of a statue and share the germs of a hundred other travelers that way!</p><p>While we were in town we found an internet cafe, where for the price of a cup of coffee we could get all the free internet we wanted.  It was nice to have some high speed internet for a change.</p><p>We just got back from a tour of the bridge.  It was very interesting and one of the officers confirmed that the wind was very strong this morning.  He said the maximum gust was 99 knots.  Thats about 113 mph for you non-nautical types.  So what do you do when you have a twelve story floating building and the wind is blowing against one side of the building at 113 mph?  Several things, it turns out.  The ship has stabilizers that can be deployed to counteract the forces of the wind.  These protrude out of the ship under the water at an angle like long wings that are under the water.  In addition there is water ballast that can be pumped from one side of the ship to the other to counteract the wind and the seas.  So when you consider that we had a strong current, 15 foot waves, and strong winds gusting to over 100 mph its amazing how little rocking and rolling the ship actually did.</p><p>Here are a couple of photos I snapped while we were on the bridge:</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2431.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/80967d2a05.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2431\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p> </p><p><img title=\"IMG_2434.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/baa20ec75d.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2434\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>Since we are back we are also getting ready to host a little party in our room for some of the people we've met on board.  The party will start here, and then we'll also visit some of the rooms and suites that others have.  This is a great way to see what kind of room you might like to have the next time you come on board.  Here's a shot that I took on the balcony of our friends Jonathan and Nancy.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2449.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/801b0fd254.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2449\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p> </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-1207236459462121750?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>Ushuaia is the southernmost city in the world.  It is in the Patagonia region, and the Tierra Del Fuego province of Argentina.  Thats a lot of geographical trivia for you in one statement.  Another fun fact about Ushuaia is that the Pan American Highway comes to an end here.  You can see Jane and I standing by the sign marking the southern end of the highway.  It doesn't look like much of a highway at this point since it is gravel, but nevertheless you could get on this road and start riding and 17,848 km later you would find yourself in Alaska.  Now that would be a bike ride.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2348.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5d9dc65260.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2348\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>Although Ushuaia is the southernmost city in the world we are not as far south as you might imagine our latitude is only as far south as Washington DC is north, so there are no issues with permafrost or any of the other problems that plague the far north cities.  Interestingly though, there are glaciers very near the city, and we cruised by them and hiked near them today.  Ushuaia is located on the Beagle channel.  This is the channel that the famous ship carrying Charles Darwin discovered.</p><p>Our day in Ushuaia was full of hiking with people we've met from Cruise Critic.  There were 11 of us that had joined in a private tour with Christine and Craig from Australia.  Our driver and guide, Edgar, was very pleasant, and knowledgeable.  He stayed awake the entire trip!  He hiked with us and pointed out interesting plants and things along the way.  Our main hiking was in the Tierra del Fuego National Park.  Here are a couple of photos to give you an idea of how pretty it was.  Jane and I are going to try to find an Internet Cafe in Punta Arenas so hopefully with some speedier connectivity I can get some larger versions uploaded to Flickr.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2299.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7c5901bb03.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2299\" width=\"400\" height=\"265\" /></p><p> </p><p><img title=\"IMG_2314.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9e7c8f0368.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2314\" width=\"398\" height=\"600\" /></p><p>One of the interesting things I discovered on the hike was how similar this area is compared to northern minnesota.  Its striking how the effects of the glaciers leave exactly the same marks even though we are in completely different parts of the world.  In some places you would think you were on the shores of lake superior instead of standing next to the Beagle Channel.</p><p>After hiking in the national park all morning, we got in the van and drove to the ski area above the city.  Here we were able to take a ski lift up the mountain to another hiking area.  If we had more time we could have continued to hike up the mountain to the glacier.  Sadly, the hike was too long and we didn't want to miss the ship!  While we were doing a short hike at the top of the lift we were lucky enough to see an Albatross soaring in the sky.  These birds are huge, with wingspans of up to 3.5 meters!  Sadly it was too far away to get a decent picture.</p><p>Here's a shot of the view on the way down the ski lift.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2377.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/af6327f404.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2377\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>And here you can see our ship on the pier with the city in the foreground.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2379.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/d41602ee6c.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2379\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>So far I would say that Ushuaia is my favorite city of the cruise.</p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2052627242064023122?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>The city of Punta Del Este has about 10,000 regular inhabitants, even though when you look at the picture of it you could easily imagine that it hosts ten times that number.  This is because Punta Del Este is a huge vacation getaway for much of South America.  All of the apartments in the high rise buildings are vacation homes.  Punta Del Este itself is mostly situated on a big peninsula with beaches on both sides.  The beaches on the west side are at the Platta river, the same one that starts in Brazil and flows through the Tigre Eelta north of Buenos Aires.  The beaches on the east are on the Atlantic ocean, and you can see the fresh and salt water mix together off the tip of the peninsula.</p><p><em><img title=\"IMG_2071.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1a25c5b8d4.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2071\" width=\"600\" height=\"397\" /></em></p><p>We didn't have anything in particular planed for our day in Punta del Este, so we just took the tender ashore with the idea that we would walk around and check things out.  However when we got off the ship and started our walk through town, there it was, Bike Tours!  One lone woman holding a bike tour sign, of course we had to check it out.  Her name was Alice and she said she could take us on a two hour tour of the city, tell us about the history and highlights of the area, and of course we would do it all on bike.  Yay!  The price was very reasonable too, so here's my digital shout-out to <a href=\"http://www.biketoursuruguay.com\">Bike Tours Uruguay</a> Its a great way to see the town, and Alice even has other longer tours that will take you north into some of the other outlying areas.</p><p>After we got our bikes, helmets, and water our first stop was the most famous work of art in Punta del Este.  The \"hand in the sand\"  This was a sculpture that won a big art contest sponsored by the city back in the mid 1980's.  It is literally a giant stone hand coming out of the sand on the beach.  Here's Jane and I in front of the middle finger.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2063.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ac39554a6b.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2063\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /></p><p>We continued our tour down the atlantic side enjoying the sites and sounds of the beaches.  The picture at the top is taken looking north back up the beach.  When you get to the point of the peninsula there is an observation deck to go out on, where you can enjoy the view looking back up the river as well as out to sea.  On the atlantic side there is an island where many hundreds of sea lions live, that is another tour for another day...  Some of our dinner table mates took that tour and said it was fun but pretty smelly when you get in amongst all of the sea lions.</p><p>When we got to the point our guide pointed out the island, and a small marker right off the point, and then another landmark off the the west.  According to the guide there is a large but rather narrow triangle  described by these three points.</p><p>Within this triangle is one of the places on earth that has amazing energy.  Oops, now I'm thinking what kind of strange new age mumbo jumbo guide did we get ourselves mixed up with.  But stay with me for a minute.   This triangle also encompasses the Punta del Este lighthouse, seen below.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2085.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2ee0d0e193.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2085\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" /></p><p>Now, right next to the lighthouse is a little park area with a compass rose made out of stone.  You can see Jane standing on the compass rose facing south.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2086.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/72916560c1.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2086\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>Here's the remarkable thing.  When you stand on the center of the compass rose and begin to speak you experience something really amazing.  Its like your voice echos inside your head in a really strong resonant way.  When our guide told us about this I was extremely skeptical.  I could just hear her telling me,  \"What you couldn't feel it?  Its so strong I can't believe you didn't experience the power....\"  But when I stood there and started talking it was amazing.  I'm not sure what causes it, but I did do some googling and apparently there are some strong magnetic forces that converge in the Punta del Este area that have been scientifically investigated.  When I get home I'm going to have to do some more research to see if I can figure out what might cause this internal acoustic effect.  (unless of course Mike has it figured out for me first)  If you have any theories of your own, please leave them in the comments!</p><p>We continued to bike around the peninsula, and up the river side.  We stopped at the fish market to see some sea lions, getting a late lunch, and from there we also had a great view of our ship as seen through many of the ships in the marina.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2100.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9e03738690.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2100\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>Sea Lions at the fish market</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2111.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/acba1b1499.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 2111\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>For a day where we had absolutely nothing planned this turned out to be a great adventure.  Seeing a city by bike is great, it gives you a good perspective and allows you to see the sites from outside, rather than being stuck inside a car or van.</p><p>Today we are at sea the whole day, on our way to Puerto Madryn.  There are lots of activities scheduled, and lots of time for reading and relaxing today.  We are looking forward to a nice quiet day -- After we go to our first boot camp workout!  The ship is also hosting a get together for all of the people on the Cruise Critic message boards, so that will also be a chance to meet some people in person that we have only communicated with electronically.  So, goodbye for now, I'll give you an update in a couple of days when we are through Puerto Madryn.</p><p> </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-4933315479554646638?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>It was a beautiful two days in Buenos Aires.  Lets start with moving in to our room on the ship.  Other than the taxi driver overcharging us dumb Americans for the ride from the airport to the Puerta de Crucera everything about the checkin process went very well.  Our room is great, we have this curved wall of windows that makes you feel like you are just suspended out over the water.  Our sitting area is really a great place to just hang out and watch the sea go by.  The luggage all arrived intact, and we were even able to smuggle a few bottles of wine we picked up at the airport onto the ship.</p><p>We had two nice surprises on checkin:  First, our room is close enough to the Internet Cafe that we actually get a wireless signal in the room, and because we are in a suite we get 180 minutes of free wireless.  That may not last the whole trip but its a good start.  The second surprise was that we had a complimentary meal at the SS United States for our first night on the ship.  This is the only specialty restaurant on board, and it is definitely a good one.</p><p>It was hard to choose from the menu there were so many good options.  I had Diver Scallops wellington with truffle emulsion, Lobster Bisque, Surf &amp; Turf (more lobster tail for the surf part) and of course chocolate souffle for desert.  Jane had similar except she had a pear and goat cheese tart instead of the diver scallops, and a salad instead of the bisque. We washed it all down with a nice bottle of Far Niente Chardonnay.</p><p>When we were leaving the restaurant the cruise director happened to be outside the door taping a segment for the next days onboard news and information channel.  We waited until we though it was safe for us to sneak by him inconspicuously, but that was not to be.  He spotted us and pulled us over for a quick on camera interview about our dining experience.  So, now we are famous for a few days.</p><p>Our second day in BA was even better than the first.  The main activity for the day was a delta river cruise.  Just north of Buenos Aires is a huge river delta, formed by the Plata river as it finishes its journey from the mountains of brazil and empties into the Atlantic Ocean.  We met our tour guides out front of the cruise terminal and they drove us through the city, pointing out interesting sites along the way.  Actually our driver and the owner of the company, Gaston, didn't say too much since he did not speak English, but our guide and interpreter did a great job.</p><p>We arrived at the Marina and got on board the boat.  It was a beautiful new 30 foot cabin cruiser, perfect for river cruising.  We took off up one of the main channels and just cruised along enjoying the sun and warm weather.  We laughed a bit at the fact that there are actually billboards along the side of the channel.  This gives you an idea of the amount of water traffic that uses this part of the river.  In fact the delta is home to a lot of people who commute by boat, and is the equivalent of going up to the lake for many other BA residents.  Everything in the delta uses water for transportation.  Everything from grocery delivery to garbage pickup is done by water.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_1960.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/07f94593c9.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 1960\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>Need some groceries?  You just put a bag over the end of a pole on your dock and the grocery boat will stop for you.  On garbage day you just hang your bags of garbage out on the end of the dock and the garbage boat takes them away.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_1961.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/432aad91e0.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 1961\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p>After cruising through some residential areas we anchored in a very peaceful side channel to have some lunch... A nice local cerveza and some meat and cheese.  It was good, and light, which was perfect since we were still plenty full from our meal the night before.  Note to mike and Sarah, We signed up for six sessions of boot camp while we are on board, and although the first session was during our tour, we did work out before hand!</p><p>After the tour we got dropped off in downtown Buenos Aires where we walked through the busy city streets, and looked at the shops and bought a souvenir for Josh.  Josh:  check out the Buenos Aires football clubs.</p><p>Of course we had the obligatory lifeboat drill, but then we enjoyed our sail away from Beuenos Aires in our room:<img title=\"IMG_1981.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c1a3301f74.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 1981\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p><img title=\"IMG_1969.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8ad035cf2e.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 1969\" width=\"400\" height=\"266\" /></p><p> </p><p>At dinner we went to our regular table in the main dining room, its located right next to the windows on the very back of the ship next to the captains table.  There was a little mixup at first with 10 of us thinking we belonged at this table for 8.  The waiter got that sorted out by moving this english couple to their proper table.  It seems that they were seated at our table the night before when 6 of us were eating at other places.  We really seem to have a nice table:  One couple from Houston TX, another from Ohio, she is the dean of a small college,  and another couple from New Jersey.  We had very good conversation, and it looks like it will be fun to get together and compare notes with them each night.</p><p> </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-8641071110192282145?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>Have you ever had an experience where afterwards you said, \"it took my breath away!\"?  Today was one of those experiences for me.  I was awake, with the sun, at about 6:30 this morning;  3AM back in Decorah, but we were so tired from the previous two days that we were in bed before 10, and slept soundly through the night.  After having some coffee and breakfast in the hotel, Jane and I took off on the \"Inferior Falls\" hike.  The inferior falls trail is the lower trail that takes you down to the base of the falls and the river.  We were literally the only ones on the trail, and it seemed that around each turn there was a view of the falls more beautiful than the last.  I posted a bunch of photos to my <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bonelake/sets/72157626145929036/\">flickr</a> account, its a lot of waterfall pictures, but you just can't capture the beauty of it all with a camera.  I've been experimenting with the exposure bracketing feature of my camera, and so some of these are three images combined into one using the HDR editor on Aperture.</p><p>As we neared the bottom of the trail we spotted a pair Toucans up in the tree, along with several other interesting birds. You can see the Toucan in the picture below.   At this point we were also able to buy our tickets for the boat trip under the falls....  But first there was a walkway that went right up to the falls.</p><p><img title=\"P2250043.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8f309ea2cd.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Toucan Sam\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p><p>I am the person in the mist in the picture below.  This was one of those wild kingdom kind of moments..  In your best Marlin Perkins voice you can say:  \"While Jane stays safely dry at the beginning of the platform Brad will tame the raging river and get drenched.\"  And this was the experience that literally took my breath away.  You just can't believe the force of the falls until you get right up to it like I did.  The wind that is created by the crashing of the water is like being in a thunder storm, and before I even realized what was going on, I was completely soaked from head to toe.  Between the force of the wind, and the perceived force of the water my breath just went right out of my lungs.</p><p> </p><p><img title=\"P2250051.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c33fa8a986.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Brad in the falls\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" /></p><p>As I think about my own experience standing at the end of the platform, I have to wonder about the people that built this thing!  Who in their right mind would go to work each morning,  to build something where you were thinking that if you slipped, (and I'm sure that during construction it was plenty slippery) you would get smashed against the rocks below you by water with thousands of pounds of force.</p><p>There is lots of wildlife in the park, we saw many species of birds, and a little hamster size rodent.  Others in our group saw a snake eating a frog -- sorry I missed that one.  But the most prevalent creature were these little things that we though were ringtail lemurs, but the locals had a different name for them.  Here's one of them begging lunch off another tourist.  Their snouts are quite long, and we were told that they are a member of the anteater family.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_1865.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5667cd7d95.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"lunch\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></p><p>After our experience on the platform, our next goal was the boat ride.  On this ride you get some great views of the falls from the river, and assuming you have a waterproof camera, some good pictures.  Then after you have seen the beauty of the falls the captain of the boat plays a game called \"lets see how close to the falls we can get without going under.\"  In the picture below you can see the boat ahead of us headed into the falls.  I'll admit that when I was standing on dry land and watching this I was thinking to myself, \"who in their right mind would get into a boat and do that?\"  But, when we were actually in the boat it seemed perfectly safe, and the boat was very stable.</p><p><img title=\"P2250055.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/aa7aa7067f.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Into the falls\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" /></p><p>Jane had the Flip video camera inside a waterproof bag when we got on the boat but mostly the video is a wall of white, and sound.  Here's a little bit of video from when we are near the falls, but not yet in the roiling water:</p><p><img title=\"VID00030.MP4\" src=\"marsedit://pending/29C2A8FB-AD3E-4932-9B9C-B84C6917C8C2/\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Falls Video\" /></p><p>We were really glad we did the boat ride, as we got to see the even larger Brazilian falls that you can't see from the hiking trails in Argentina.</p><p>After hiking back up to the hotel, we picked up my camera and got a new battery for the waterproof camera and set out for the train ride to El Diablo, this is another cool little hike where you go out to the top of the very large falls, and stand and watch the water spill over.  The water levels are quite high this year which makes everything even more spectacular.  Here's a couple of shots from the top of the falls.  Again, there are more without me in them on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/bonelake/sets/72157626145929036/\">flickr</a>.</p><p> </p><p><img title=\"IMG_1855.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/0c9306a230.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 1855\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" /></p><p>After all of this hiking in the Jungle heat and humidity, we were quite tired and hot, so we headed back to the pool at the hotel to relax and rest up for a while.  Our final stop of the day was back in the city of Puerto Iguazu where we had a dinner reservation at Aqva restaurant.</p><p>We booked a round trip cab ride (200 pesos) at the front desk, which turned out to be a great deal.  We had a very personable cab driver named Ronny, who took us for a little site seeing and shopping before dropping us off at the restaurant.  After dropping us off he waited for us to eat and then took us back to the hotel.  Before dinner we had a beautiful view of the river from the city, where you can see Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay at the three corners of where the river splits.</p><p>The restaurant is decorated in Pacific Northwest style, and the food is a great blend of Argentinian and Italian cuisine.  We had a fantastic meal of Argentine steak and a lovely bottle of Malbec.  My steak came with a leak tart which was surprisingly delicious, and Jane had potatoes that were stuffed with cheese and ham.  The service was top notch, and we had the opportunity to chat with the owner, Jorge Antonio, who was very nice.... We topped off our dinner with a tiny bit of Limoncello.  The Limoncello was quite possibly the best we have ever tasted, so we asked the owner if he made it himself or imported it from Italy.  He said he made it himself and promised to share his top secret recipe with us if we sent him an email.  Just when we thought we were ready to leave the owner brought us a complimentary glass of Argentinian champagne to keep us happy for the ride back to the hotel.  If you get to Iguazu you should definitely check out Aqva.</p><p> </p><p> </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-5151263568237331527?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>And so it begins.  Another travel adventure.  This one just Jane and I.  The itinerary is a South American Cruise from Buenos Aires, Argentina around Cape Horn and up to Valparaiso, Chile; with many stops along the way.  Here's a summary of Days one and two.</p><p>We left Decorah with our friends John and Llew at 8:00AM to drive to the airport, we have several plans for getting back from the airport -- the nice thing is that we didn't need to park our car at $20 per day for 16 days.  While we are away Josh and our God daughter Liz are in charge of the house.  Decorah friends take note of that last sentence!  We are flying American all day, and of course the first face I see when we get to the American Counter is the infamous Cat -- see my first post from JTerm travels.  Luckily we got our luggage checked in just fine without her.  When we got to the gate we checked with the gate agent to see if we could change our seats on the Dallas to Buenos Aires portion of the flight.  I really wanted to find a seat with a power port.  Nine hours in the air could require a recharge of the iPad.  She was so nice that she moved us to a bulkhead/exit row seat -- nine hours of legroom!!</p><p>The rest of the air travel was uneventful, and we arrived in BA right on time.  Jane and I both managed at couple of hours of napping during the night, but nothing particularly restful.  BA is 3 hours ahead of central time so jet lag is not going to be a big factor.  Once off the plane we had to go through immigration and passport control.  We have to pay $140 each to visit Argentina, this is listed as reciprocity for the Visas that we make the Argentinians pay.</p><p>The plan was to get through immigration as quickly as possible and get on our car to the other airport (Jorge Newberry) where we are taking a flight to Iguazu for two days before the cruise.   We had reserved the 3:05 flight but were really hoping to get to the airport in time for the 11:35 flight.  We knew it would be tight but were hoping to avoid spending valuable hours in the airport.  Here's where the plan started to fray...  After paying our reciprocity fee we got shunted out of the line for people from the US into the line for Argentinians and other visitors.  This line ended up being much longer and slower.  As the minutes ticked away we resigned ourselves to an afternoon in the airport.  We did meet two very nice women who were traveling alone, one was going to antarctica as part of an academic expedition and the other was celebrating her birthday by going horseback riding.</p><p>We ended up sharing our car with Denise -- the horseback rider -- The drive from BA International to Jorge Newberry is supposed to take anywhere from 15 minutes to 3 hours depending on who you read and what time of day, our drive was a harrowing 45 minutes.  Drivers here make up their own lanes and rules as they go along.  We got to the airport just after 11:00 which we were sure was too late for the 11:35 flight.  But luck was with us and the flight was delayed by an hour, so we were able to change to the earlier flight  -- with no change fee!</p><p>We cleared security and found our way to gate 3 where we met up with several people from the cruise critic message board, I'll just call them the CC people until I get to know them better.  Jane has been conversing online with some of these people for almost a year, and it was fun to meet up with some fellow americans to pass the time.</p><p>We arrived at the Iguazu airport, and the plane parked at one of the two gates.  We waited forever for Jane's bag, and then got a cab to the Sheraton, which is located in the Iguazu National Park.  To summarize, we left Decorah at 8:00AM on the 24th and we arrived in Iguazu at 3:00 on the 25th.  A long days of travel! Just as we left the airport it started to rain, hard!  But, by the time we got checked in to our room and started to think about what to do with the rest of the day the rain stopped again.</p><p>Iguazu is amazing!  The falls here are huge, you just can't believe the volume of water that pours over these things every second.  For those of you as old as me who are into movies at all, these falls are the sight of the movie The Mission.  Here's one picture to whet your appetite.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_1817_8_9_tonemapped.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6aaef8b228.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG 1817 8 9 tonemapped\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" /></p><p>I took this one on what is called the upper falls hike.  Its probably the driest hike we are going to take.  Next up is the lower falls hike which I will do in my swimsuit, and a boat ride that goes right up to the falls.</p><p>To finish off the story of our first day, we met up with the CC group again to have a drink in the hotel bar and dinner together.  I think this is going to be very nice to know a few people going into the cruise.  The dinner was pretty good.  Jane had seafood risotto and I had a nice Argentine steak.  The funniest thing was that Jane got dripped on through a leak in the roof when the rain started up again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-512103486512550459?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>4:00 PM Laguardia Airport</p><p>I have never wanted to be home so badly in all my life.  The group of 16 is sitting here in the American Eagle concourse of Laguardia.  We are at the airport very early for several reasons.  Number one, they are remodeling the lobby of the Seafarers and it sounded like the entire building was going to fall down.  Number two, the \"seafarers\" watching TV on the Mezzanine were on their second bottle of alcohol (gin for breakfast and whiskey for lunch) and were starting to creep everyone out.  Number three we though that this mornings snow might have traffic all backed up and we didn't want to be fretting our way through security, but as it turned out we got over here in no time at all.  Number five, we feared that there would be long lines at checkin and security due to flight changes and cancellations, which also proved to be a non-issue.  So, here we sit, two hours before boarding, the flight is on time so far...</p><p>The morning started out early, I was wide awake at 4AM, my mind on the trip home today.  We had to be out the door at 7AM to catch our train to Stamford Connecticut, where we visited NBC.  We had two great speakers today John Fritsche, and Bucky Gunt (Google him, he's won a ton of Emmys).  Unfortunately as we were on the train to Stamford some lovely white flakes of snow began to come out of the sky.  Sadly in New York even a few white flakes raise havoc with the schedules at Laguardia, Newark, and JFK.  On top of that tomorrow there is a winter storm watch out for our area.</p><p>Backing up to this morning again.  We got to the Union Square station where we were going to take any of the uptown bound trains to grand central station.  We told everyone, if the cars are crowded meet up on the platform  The cars were indeed crowded but after our london experience you would not believe how proficient our students have become at jamming themselves onto a subway.  So we all made it onto the train.  But not 30 seconds after we got off both Craig and I came up one student short.  I knew that student was on the train because I saw him and talked to him on the way to grand central.  But just like that he was gone!  Where did he go?  Did he fail to \"mind the gap?\"  Was he abducted by a band of roving gypsies?  Did a crazed herd of subway rats drag him away?  We had to move to the platform to catch our train to Stamford and unfortunately this student did not have his cell phone along.  So one stayed behind until the last possible minute to see if he returned, and the rest of us went on to catch our Stamford train.  Sadly, we had lost him.  Well, I knew that other than missing the NBC presentations he would be fine.  He could always go back to the hotel and meet us there later.</p><p>As we were standing in the snow in Stamford he finally called.  He was at a pay-phone and was safe and sound.  He had gone up the stairs following someone in a coat that looked suspiciously like Craig's.  After following not-craig for a while he finally realized that he was following the wrong guy.  By then he didn't know how to get back to us and we were probably gone by then anyway.  We are all hopeful that this will be the final mass transit mishap of the trip!  -- A short update craig just surmised that our inbound plane is 20 minutes ahead of schedule.  So, the good news is that we have an inbound plane, it is in the air, and it is ahead of schedule.  Yea!!</p><p>5:30  Well, scratch that... Our plane is actually now going to arrive about 16 minutes late.  It took off late from Charlotte, so is behind schedule.</p><p>9:23 CST:  Finally off the plane, after landing only about a minute late we were informed by the captain that an AA 737 landed just 10 seconds ahead of us.  Unfortunately they only have one ground crew so we wait on the tarmac unable to pull into our gate.  Finally we pull into the gate but we wait another 10 minutes before someone finally moves the jet bridge into place.  I'm pretty sure that was Cat having her final revenge on me for publicly calling her out in an earlier post.</p><p>But, all is well that ends well.  Even though we waited a long time (25 minutes) to get off the plane, our luggage was waiting for us at baggage claim, so there was no additional wait there.  By 10PM Craig and I were in my car, yes my car, freedom, no reliance on public transportation, no waiting for cranky gate agents, we could just get in my car and drive the last 2:20 minutes to get home to Decorah.  We arrived just after midnight.  Sweet.  It was a great trip, but there's no place like home.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-6608147763903952442?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

Partway through the tour, our guides asked for a couple of volunteers to 'do some reading'  Craig and I both volunteered, and it turned out they were going to show us how a mini news broadcast goes together.  So, Craig is the anchorman, and I am the weather guy.  Its not as easy as it looks standing in front of the green screen, reading the teleprompter, and moving pointing at something nonexistent behind you.</p><object type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" data=\"http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377\" classid=\"clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000\"><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=d8e0373a91&photo_id=5402162164\"></param><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377\"></param><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://www.flickr.com/apps/video/stewart.swf?v=71377\" bgcolor=\"#000000\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" flashvars=\"intl_lang=en-us&photo_secret=d8e0373a91&photo_id=5402162164\" height=\"225\" width=\"400\"></embed></object><p>Sadly Flickr uses flash to do these embedded videos, Here's a link to the mov non flash file I uploaded...

We sat in the neutral zone of the stadium so we were not right in with the Fulham or the Stokes City fans.  So our section was a bit quieter than all the others.  We were the closest to the Stokes City visitors section and it was really a riot to listen to them sing, and chant, and carry on throughout the game.  They only quieted down about midway through the second half when it became very clear that there was no way they were going to win the game.</p><p>There were a couple of Dads right behind me that had brought their two young boys to the game, so it was interesting to listen to them explain football to the boys, who already knew as much about the game as many of us.  It was a great experience and one that I will remember fondly for a long time.</p><p>The last few days are really a blur.  We have had more great meetings and class discussions, and finally some time to explore the city on our own.  Quite honestly I'm 'museumed out' at the moment.  I've been to The British Museum, The London Transportation Museum, the Tate Modern, The London Docklands, The Imperial War Museum, and the British Library.  All were interesting in their own way, but you get museum, and information overload at some point.</p><p>A couple of the highlights for me were the Transportation Museum, seeing the development of the London Underground, beginning in the 1830s and moving forward is a pretty interesting study in engineering, and city planning.   The development of tunneling technologies, and the escalator were really interesting.</p><p>Another highlight was seeing a letter from Ada Lovelace to Charles Babbage at the British Library.  The library has labelled this letter as the first computer program, as she is explaining how to program the difference engine to solve a mathematical problem that had never been solved by hand before.  Also at the Library was Handel's original score for the Messiah!  You could see his notes as well as the names of the soloists that were performing the different parts.  They also have one of four copies of the Magna Carta on display.  This is a document written in 1215 or so, and is widely considered to be a model for our own constitution.</p><p>Last night we had our final group dinner in London, and the Imperial China restaurant.  We had our own room, with a Karaoke machine and a special menu.  Tons of food, and great fun was had singing karaoke by all.    Here you can see Paul, Joe, and Carl treating us to a country song.  We also had Rap, Glen Campbell, and even a couple of Disco numbers.  It is really strange to think that all of these students know the lyrics to every Backstreet boys song ever written.</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2305.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6efbbe5eb2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG_2305.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /></p><p>Tomorrow is an early morning as we have to be on the Tube going to heathrow by 7:30.  We leave London at around 11:15am and arrive in New York at about 3:00pm.  We've all enjoyed our time in Europe, but we are also ready to be back in the states again.  I know that even after a proper football game this afternoon, a number of the students are hoping to make it</p><p> </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-3432422924557260243?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>Yesterday was another great day in London.  We started out at 8:00 with our daily discussion of the assigned reading.  24 of the 26 members of the class were a little unhappy about the 8:00 starting time, but the other two (Craig and I) wanted to get them up and out of bed so they would have the middle part of the day for seeing the sites of London.  This would really be the first extended time they would have since we arrived for doing some touring on their own.</p><p>We met up again at 4:00 at a place called the View Tube.  This is an educational facility that overlooks the Olympic stadium and Village area.  We met with an architect who is the project manager for the Olympic Village.  It was an absolutely fascinating meeting.  How do you design a village to house 10,000 athletes that will be turned into market housing as well as affordable housing once the games are over?  Furthermore how do you build all of this to the latest green standards?  How do you design a new city neighborhood, with safety and security as primary design constraints?  How do you move millions of people in and out of this neighborhood on a daily basis?  These are just some of the design goals for the Olympic Village and park area.  Here are a couple of pictures of the stadium and the aquatic center in construction:</p><p><img title=\"IMG_2288.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/70600e7979.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG_2288.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /></p><p><img title=\"IMG_2289.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/d1250f73eb.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG_2289.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /></p><p>The apartments that house the athletes during the games are all built without kitchens and other 'extra' rooms to provide extra bedroom space.  After the games the kitchens are added before they go on sale.  We also learned that all of these apartments are designed and built so that they do not need heating during the winter!  This is amazing to me, but we were further told that they didn't think they could sell them without heat, so in floor heating is added throughout.  The water for the in-floor heat comes from a central facility, so should it ever be needed it is extremely efficient!</p><p>This project really is amazing, the amount of social and civic engineering that has gone into the design of the village really boggles my mind.  Not only that but consider that much of this was designed, and even some construction was started before the economic crash in 2008.  The crash led to a full time out to re-evaluate and re-finance much of the operation.  Its just amazing that they are going to pull this off.</p><p>After our meeting at the View Tube, we all scattered for dinner on our own and then met up again at the Dominion Theater for We Will Rock You.  This is a musical where the plot and characters are loosely based around the Bohemian Rhapsody .  Lots of great Queen songs that we all wanted to sing along with.  Craig and I had our dinner at the Tottenham Pub, and I decided that I really needed to try a meat pie during my stay in London, so I had a chicken and mushroom pie for supper.  I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.</p><p> </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-1758184722208780685?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

You can see the lamps in the picture below.  In April the grounds keepers begin mowing the grass shorter and shorter.  By competition time the grass is down to just 6 millimeters in length.  The cutting must be done very gradually or the grass will go into shock, and you know thats not good.</li></ol><p> </p><p><img title=\"IMG_2285.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/19d67a69f8.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"IMG_2285.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" />Finally, testing begins.  A person comes in and literally counts the blades of grass per square meter to make sure the turf is the right density, and that the tennis ball will bounce to the correct height. when dropped from a test machine.</p><p>We also got to go in the press room, and sit in the chairs where the players come every day to give their interviews.  It was fun to sit in the same chair as Nadal, Federer, and MacEnroe.</p><p>We were allowed to sit in the stands on court 1 as well as Centre Court, so we got a good idea of how intimate the Wimbledon stadiums are and what it would be like to actually attend a match.  After the stadium tour we had a marketing presentation and learned a little about the way they market the stadium and the museum during the other 50 weeks of the year.  All in all it was an impressive experience.</p><p> </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-6919700742587553671?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>The first stop on our tour of London was a walking tour around the Olympic venues.  To get there was easy.  Take the Picadilly line from Russel Square up to Kings Cross St. Pancras and transfer to the Hammersmith and City line which would take us East directly to Bromley by Bow where we would meet our guide.  Nothing could be easier right?  Except that when we got to Kings Cross, the train to Bromley by Bow was pretty full.  But we jammed ourselves on like true Londoners.  At the last second I noticed that some of our students had not jammed themselves on the train and a voice in the back of my head said 'jump off.'  I ignored the little voice because we had given them clear instructions that if they didn't make it on this train just jump on the next on and we would meet up on the platform at our destination.</p><p>When we arrived at Bromley by Bow, we did a quick count and realized we had a little more than half of our group.  When the next train pulled in we looked for the rest of the group, but not a single student got off the train.  Soon another train pulled in and I noticed that this was a district line train so I didn't expect any students to get off.  Well, train after train came into the station but they were all district line trains.  That voice in the back of my head told me 'somethings not right'  so I went up to the ticket office to inquire when the next Hammersmith and City train was expected.  \"Service is suspended.\" he told me.</p><p>\"Till when?\"  I asked.</p><p>\"indefinitely.\" I was told.</p><p>Crap!  Why didn't I listen to that voice that told me to jump off the train?  Time to regroup.  Craig and I decided that he would take the students that were here on the tour and I would wait at the station.  We knew that within the group there was the intelligence to figure out a way to get down to the district line and out here eventually.  I would meet them and call craig and we would figure out how to catch up.</p><p>So, Craig and the guide and the group took off in the rain on the tour and I hung out in the station.  Pretty soon I noticed that there were not any district line trains coming in any more.  So, back to the information desk.  Yep, District line service is also suspended due to signaling problems at Bow Road station.  Well, that does it, I had already waited around the station for 40 minutes so there was no way they were going to make it now and even if they did the tour would be finishing up.  So I hopped on the next train heading back in.  As I passed each station, I scanned the faces on the platform on the other side.  If I saw the group I could hop off and catch up with them.  But they were no where to be seen.</p><p>It took me about an hour to get back to Russell square and our hotel and when I walked in a group of the cheerfully greeted me in the lobby.  \"We tried to catch up with you but all the lines were suspended.\"  They had their own odyssey of planes and busses and walking in the rain that you can read about on the class blog.  (olympicsjterm11.blogspot.com).  They had tried their best using all of their ingenuity to catch up with us, but it just was not to be.  They were all safe, and sound and much the better for having to learn how to navigate the London Tube system on their own.</p><p>Now, if you have been following this blog you may be wondering how on earth I came to be allowed to lead students abroad.  Torn ligaments, separated shoulders, leaving students behind on busses and trains.  Is there any defense for all that?  Nope, these are ingenious  Luther students, in every case they knew where they had to be and how to get there.  In my mind this is part of the experience of learning how to navigate your way around a foreign country.  We're having a blast and we'll make sure we get everyone home in one piece.</p><p>Today we are off to Wimbledon, and looking forward to our meetings and tour there.  But, if I do hear that voice telling me to jump off the train to stay with the group, I think I'll listen to it today.</p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7361298176501809442?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>A few years ago, I finished a round of Golf at Oneota Country Club and came up to the patio area.  A  bunch of guys I knew were sitting around a table with some other men I did not know.  It turned out that the strangers were visiting Decorah on a Rotary International exchange program from Torino Italy.  One of the men I met that night was Stefano.  Little did I know that he would play and integral role in the course on the olympic games I'm teaching right now.</p><p>When craig proposed the course, and we talked about Torino, we  both thought of Stefano.  I contacted him via email, and he immediately responded that he would be happy to help.  Stefano organized a very nice morning for us.  He stopped at our hotel to walk with us to the Foundacion Alberto Collonetti, where some of his friends were gathered.  The friends had all been involved in the Olympics in some way as volunteers, and they told told us a bit about what they had done, and what the Olympics had meant to Torino.  Although some of the venues have very quickly decayed and are going unused, everyone agreed that the Olympics had a big economic and cultural impact on the city.  Before the olympics Torino was probably only known as the home of the shroud, and was not really a tourist destination, but since the olympics Torino has become a tourist destination for people from throughout the world.  In addition the olympics had a big impact on the character of the people, according to many that we spoke with, prior to the olympics people in Torino were not very welcoming of strangers, but since then the city has learned to be more friendly and open.  We saw this to some degree, but in general we found it was difficult to find someone that could speak english.  This was such a different experience than I have had traveling in other cities in Italy.  After the presentations were over they answered the students questions for quite a while.  We were happy to use some of our honoraria money to make a small donation to the Foundacion.</p><p>Stefano and his friend Fabrizio helped us the rest of the day by accompanying us to the Olympic Village, to lunch, and even to our second meeting of the day with Delatre.  For lunch we walked through the abandoned village and over to a rehabilitated Fiat factory.  The factory has been turned into a mall, and office building.  Across the street from the end of the mall is a place called Eataly, which is a very nice high end grocery store (more on this later) that also has a cafeteria.  We bought Stefano and Fabrizio lunch, and it was nice to have Stefano translate the menu for us. We had a very nice glass of Prosecco naturale, not the champagne version but the still version.  Craig and I each had a plate of pasta with meat sauce (veal) while the others had pasta and mussels.</p><p>A couple of bus rides later and we were at Delatre.  This is a technology company that does a lot of web work for NBC, the BBC, and CTV.  Their big thing is tying together the video stream with all the meta data about the players and the scores.  For broadcasters they basically provide everything you would need to know to do color commentary on a game.  They license some cool technology that tracks each football player on the pitch, as well as the ball and the referees.  The software can detect when one player passes to another, and provides real time statistics.  You can access this on the website, like nbcolympics.com,  or they have a special product just for broadcasters to use.  It was a very interesting presentation, especially for the 3 computer scientists in the group.</p><p>After the presentation they allowed craig to stay behind to print out our boarding passes.  I took the rest of the group down the road to the grocery store.  The original idea was to wait for craig, but we soon gave up on that and began walking back to the hotel on our own.</p><p>We knew that to get back to the hotel we just had to walk east until we found Corso Re Umberto.  At that point we would go north to our hotel.  I knew it was a long way, so once we reached Re Umberto I said I would run across the road and see if the bus went all the way up to our hotel.  Unfortunately as I was asking the bus driver this question, he just started driving away.  I tried to wave to the confused looking students on the other side of the road, who were staring at the place the bus used to be as if I had somehow vanished into thin air.  I did manage to make eye contact with one or two so they knew I was on the bus and they soon followed.  Meanwhile back at the hotel we waited and waited for craig.  Finally I decided not to wait any longer and just go ahead with our group discussion.  When craig finally returned we had our first glimpse of what flying Ryanair was going to be like.  To print out our online boarding passes he had to enter, name, birthday, passport number, expiration date, flight information for every member of our group before he could print out the passes!  Of course this took forever, especially since on the first try he entered all of the information only to be told that the session had time out.  This meant he had to enter it all over again, but in smaller batches.</p><p>After the group discussion we walked down the block to ottoe tre quarte (8 3/4) where we had a glass of wine and some Calzone.  After dinner we were both exhausted so we just went back to the hotel to get some sleep.  Lest you think I was in bed by 7, you should know that supper time in this part of italy doesn't start until 8:00pm.</p><p> </p><p> </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-3817729527587259455?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>Sometimes a Swiss Army Knife can make you the most popular guy in your hotel corridor!  Some of the students have discovered that when you are in italy, and close to France, wine is much cheaper than beer.  What do you do if you are not a wine drinker?  Choose an inexpensive wine at random from a store and bring it back to the hotel.  Step 2, after realizing that wine bottles have these things called corks, and corks require a special tool to remove them from your bottle, you wander around the corridor wondering how you are going to find a cork screw.  This is where I came in.</p><p>\"Do you know where we can find a corkscrew?\"  I was asked.  Being a leader makes me the font of all knowledge of course, so I must know.  \"Well...\" I said, \"I have a corkscrew on my swiss army knife.\"  \"Great!  can you open this for me?\"  Why not, I thought... Somehow the idea of me opening a bottle of wine for a student wasn't anywhere on my list of duties as a faculty member, and I'm not sure its one that the administration would want to cultivate, but here we are in Italy, I might as well be helpful.  So, I cut the foil and pop one cork.  Its as if the sound of that cork sliding out of the bottle was like some kind of whistle.  The next thing I know I'm surrounded by students holding bottles of wine.  One or two of them decided it would be a great idea to take a picture of me opening wine bottles.  I think the picture below really captures the moment.  You can see Craig laughing in the background as if to say,  \"ha ha, there goes Brad's career.\"</p><p><img title=\"CIMG7035.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/aadccc6a69.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"CIMG7035.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /></p><p>Thus began our first night in Torino.  It was another long train trip from Lausanne to Torino, made a bit more exciting by the fact that just after we crossed the border into Italy the train got behind schedule.  What had been a 40 minute layover in Milano Centrale turned into a 10 minute dash from one train to the next.</p><p>Once we got to Torino, we had lunch, our first at McDonalds since the trip began, because we knew we were too early to check into our hotel.  I had a McBacon and fries.  It tasted quite good.  The Hotel Artua Solferino is a nice old European hotel.  Each room is very different.  My room is up the stairs at the end of the hall, and has the smallest bathroom in Italy.  Right over my shower is a skylight that leaks cold air like crazy.  This morning as I tried to take a shower, I could not get hot water and so the combination of the cool breeze and the luke warm shower water (with approximately zero pressure) was pretty pathetic.</p><p>After orienting the students to the area, we turned them loose to see what they could find for dinner.  Craig and I waited a while and then took off for the city centro.  We walked around and investigated a lot of restaurants.  We looked for some that might be able to accommodate our entire group, and some that looked like they might be nice for us.  We ended up finding a great little neighborhood restaurante.  Not a tourist place at all, and not pretentious.  They had a three course chefs menu that looked great.  I had awesome risotto, a green salad, and delicious veal arrosto.  The meal came with 3 dl of wine which was perfecto.</p><p>With dinner done, we made our way back to the hotel.  Its amazing how tired I get each day, worrying about the 24 welfare of 24 students traveling in a foreign country where none of us really speak the language well is very tiring.  This seems to be especially true here in Torino.  Although we have heard that the city has made great strides in welcoming tourists, we find that there are not all that many people that really speak English.  Despite that , it is a good beginning to Torino.</p><p> </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2925398357005830028?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>The morning started out like any other morning, up at 7:00, a light breakfast, then hop on the bus to the ski slopes.  OK, maybe not like every other morning, but a pretty desirable thing to aspire to anyway.</p><p>To get to the ski slopes from Interlaken requires a bus ride, to Winderwil, followed by a train ride to Lauterbrunn, followed by a different train ride to Wengen, followed by a trip up the Mannlichen Gondola.  Unfortunately after all that trouble the quality of the snow was pretty bad.  The weather here in Interlaken the past couple of days has been unseasonably warm, so the snow is really icy in the morning, turning to slush by mid-day.  Most of the students that followed me out the door of our Hostel (Backpackers Villa Sonnenhof) were beginners.  By the end of the day they were calling themselves the Blue Crew because they were only taking the blue runs.  Note to U.S. skiiers, in the Alps blue is easy, red is intermediate, while black is for experts.  Somehow I got separated from the group right away and ended up doing the first run by myself.  It turned out that they had all skiied a ways ahead of mebut had stopped to contemplate their options in terms of which run to take.  Even after that contemplation they ended up taking a red run, which was not what they wanted to do.  It was during this first run that Aaron took a spill, and tore the ACL, and MCL ligaments in his knee.</p><p>Even though I waited at the bottom and top of the lift hoping to find the group again I was unsuccessful for several runs.  Maybe an hours worth of skiing.  Finally I did see the group coming off the blue run and the first thing I heard was \"have you seen Aaron?\"</p><p>No I said, why?</p><p>He fell and hurt himself on the run.  He told us to go on to the bottom but now we're too scared to ski back down to him.</p><p>So, I took my board down the run and found him sitting all by himself by the side of a snow making machine.  Only one person had stopped to see if he needed help, and due to the language barrier apparently determined he was fine.  Meanwhile, I had talked to a couple of ski instructors and managed to locate a ski patrol on a snowmobile.  He joined us on the slope and made the assessment that Aaron was going to need to go to Wengen for some X-Rays.  As we were waiting we decided that we needed a better cover story than falling during the first run of the day.  Hence the Lindsey Vonn reference.  Our story is that she was on the slopes practicing for the world cup race next week and decided to flirt with Aaron, this distracted him momentarily and caused him to crash.  Sadly she did not stop to help or he would probably feel just fine.</p><p>After wrapping Aaron up like a Papoose on the sled behind the snowmobile the patrol took off for the Gondola, and I was supposed to ski down and take the lift back up and meet them there.  By the time I arrived the Gondola had already taken Aaron down, so I had to wait for the next one.  Down in Wengen Aaron got a ride in a taxi to the doctor's office and was awaiting an X-ray by the time I arrived.  It only took about an hour and a half at the doctors office to get the X-Ray with the preliminary diagnosis of a torn crucial ligament.  They scheduled a followup appointment the next day so the other doctor could read the X-ray and weigh in.  They outfitted Aaron with a pair of crutches that included flip down spikes for the bottom to aid in navigating through the snow, and we were off.  Aaron with one ski boot on and his crutches, me carrying the other ski boot, his poles, helmet, skiis, and my own board, it was kind of a sad sight to see us slowly trudging through the narrow streets of Wengen back to the Bahnhoff.  Remember all the train and bus stops it took to get to Wengen?  Well we had to do the whole process in reverse loading and offloading skis, boards, etc. at each change.</p><p>Aaron and I made it back to the Hostel, where we began the process of calling our travel insurance company, Luther Study Abroad folks, and Aaron's parents.  As I write this we are in \"insurance-limbo\" waiting to hear from our company whether they will cover an MRI in Laussane.  The MRI is critical because it appears that in addition to the torn ligaments there is also a small bone chip.  If the chip is too large or in the wrong place then He'll have to go home and get ready for surgery.</p><p> </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-6493300333159428514?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\n<p>I can't believe that I actually slept until 8:00AM.  After waking up at 3 AM I was afraid I was done for, but I dropped back to sleep and slept hard until 8.  After a quick breakfast at the Hostel it was time for some Munich touring on our own.   A few of us were going to go to the Deutches Museum, but most of the group was headed to Dachau.  I really enjoyed the museum, I went straight to the Math, Computer Science, and Astronomy exhibit, where I discovered that they had an actual Enigma machine, in the cryptography area.</p><p>There were many other great exhibits, the aeronautical area had a cross section of an Airbus A320 and several other interesting aircraft, there was a really amazing mining exhibit as well.  The nautical area was equally amazing with replicas of ships both large and small.  You could easily spend a whole day at the museum, but my mind was pretty overloaded by 11:30.  The plan was to head back to the Viktalien Markt for a street lunch of sausage and bread, unfortunately everything was closed, it turns out that Epiphany is a national holiday in Germany, so we really had to work to find a street vendor that was open.  I had to try the Currywurst, which was a sausage in a sweet sauce with curry powder sprinkled over the top.  It was a delicious German meets Indian fusion street food kind of thing.</p><p>With lunch behind us we met up with the rest of the group to head back to the airport to meet with Sebastian, a marketing guy, from Lufthansa.  He gave us a great presentation on Lufthansa and their support of the Munich 2018 bid.  The Lufthansa folks had very generously provided us all with Munich 2018 stocking hats and scarves.  After the meeting we took a group photo with everyone wearing their new gifts.</p><p><img title=\"Group 2.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/34871e01b2.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Group 2.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" />After the Lufthansa meeting we returned to the Hostel for some group discussion and to get ready for our dinner at the Hofbrauhaus!  We were not in the main hall, but were upstairs in their groupdining area.  I had a fantastic dinner of veal ragout with Spaetzel, and a good size dark beer.</p><p>Dinner was pretty calm until a huge group of Canadiens came it.  It was a group of ninth grade hockey players and their parents.  Things really started to heat up when the parents started singing Canadian drinking songs and chugging their beers.  This brought on a resounding L-U, L-U, L-U-T-H, T-H, T-H, T-H-E-R from the Luther crowd and soon we were all friends.</p><p>Back at my room, sleep was hard to come by in this second night.  I mostly drifted in and out of sleep until my alarm went off at 6AM, we needed to be out of the hostel and headed for the train station by 6:45.  As I write this I am on the train to Mannheim and then Interlaken.</p><p> </p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-446006758223426517?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"title": "google app engine service login",
				"content_html": "<p>So I&rsquo;m working on an app during my sabbatical that has an iPad component and an online Google App Engine component.  The Google App Engine part is half web based and half web service based.  Of course this means that the local client part has to be able to authenticate itself to the Google App Engine before it can communicate and do useful stuff.  Finding good reliable examples of how to do this is surprisingly hard.  For the Objective C code I&rsquo;m working on I found a nice set of classes that do the trick for you here:  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On Github<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  For Python I found some example code on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stackoverflow<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  However it was not really in a reusable form.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The basic outline of what you have to do is as follows:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.  Login to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/accounts/ClientLogin\">https://www.google.com/accounts/ClientLogin</a>  This will give you an auth token.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2.  Use the token you gained in step 1 to login to your Google App engine application or service.  When you have successfully logged in to your service google will set an ACSID cookie for you to use when you make subsequent requests to your service.  This prevents you from having to login each time you make a web service request.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve taken some ideas from both places mentioned above and have created a Python class for logging in and accessing app engine services from Python.  To use this module you just need to import it and create a GoogleAppEngineLogin object.  Once the object is created you can use the open method on the object to access further services.  The open method is just a convenience wrapper around urllib2.urlopen but it also makes sure that your cookie has not expired before it makes a request.  If you have comments or suggestions for how to improve the code please let me know via email or leave a comment.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The code is reproduced below, but you can also just download the file from git clone <a href=\"mailto:git@gist.github.com\">git@gist.github.com</a>:36b1c45ed39298178907.git<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->import getpass<!-- raw HTML omitted -->import urllib<!-- raw HTML omitted -->import urllib2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->import cookielib<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->class GoogleAppEngineLogin(object):<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    &ldquo;&quot;&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   Logging in to an App Engine Account (when you use google users) is<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   a two step process: First you must login to Google generally.  This<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   gets you an auth token.  The auth token is used as part of a<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   request to login to your app/service During the login process for<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   your app/service the server sets a cookie with the name of ACSID,<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   it is this cookie and its value that serves as the authentication<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   token for your own service/app.  So, for future requests you need<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   to give the server the cookie as part of your request.

				"content_text": "\nSo I'm working on an app during my sabbatical that has an iPad component and an online Google App Engine component.  The Google App Engine part is half web based and half web service based.  Of course this means that the local client part has to be able to authenticate itself to the Google App Engine before it can communicate and do useful stuff.  Finding good reliable examples of how to do this is surprisingly hard.  For the Objective C code I'm working on I found a nice set of classes that do the trick for you here:  <a href=\"http://github.com/cameronr/GoogleAppEngineAuth\">On Github</a>  For Python I found some example code on <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/101742/how-do-you-access-an-authenticated-google-app-engine-service-from-a-non-web-p\">stackoverflow</a>.  However it was not really in a reusable form.<br /><br />The basic outline of what you have to do is as follows:<br /><br />1.  Login to https://www.google.com/accounts/ClientLogin  This will give you an auth token.<br />2.  Use the token you gained in step 1 to login to your Google App engine application or service.  When you have successfully logged in to your service google will set an ACSID cookie for you to use when you make subsequent requests to your service.  This prevents you from having to login each time you make a web service request.<br /><br />I've taken some ideas from both places mentioned above and have created a Python class for logging in and accessing app engine services from Python.  To use this module you just need to import it and create a GoogleAppEngineLogin object.  Once the object is created you can use the open method on the object to access further services.  The open method is just a convenience wrapper around urllib2.urlopen but it also makes sure that your cookie has not expired before it makes a request.  If you have comments or suggestions for how to improve the code please let me know via email or leave a comment.<br /><br />The code is reproduced below, but you can also just download the file from git clone git@gist.github.com:36b1c45ed39298178907.git<br /><pre class=\"prettyprint\" style=\"overflow: auto;\"><br />import getpass<br />import urllib<br />import urllib2<br />import cookielib<br /><br /><br />class GoogleAppEngineLogin(object):<br />    \"\"\"<br />   Logging in to an App Engine Account (when you use google users) is<br />   a two step process: First you must login to Google generally.  This<br />   gets you an auth token.  The auth token is used as part of a<br />   request to login to your app/service During the login process for<br />   your app/service the server sets a cookie with the name of ACSID,<br />   it is this cookie and its value that serves as the authentication<br />   token for your own service/app.  So, for future requests you need<br />   to give the server the cookie as part of your request.  Handling<br />   cookies can be a bit tricky if you haven't had some experience with<br />   it but luckily Python's cookielib module makes it all pretty<br />   automatic.<br /><br />    This class takes care of the whole login process for you, and then<br />    gives you a simple helper to access the URLs for your service.<br />    The helper function makes sure the cookie is still valid and<br />    passes on the request along with the cookie.  Technically you<br />    would not even need to use the helper function, you could use<br />    urllib2 directly to access your service but this seems a bit<br />    neater to me.<br /><br />    Some of this code was inspired by and lifted from an example on<br />    stackoverflow.com, but that was all in-line code my contribution<br />    is to add some error handling and encapsulate the whole thing<br />    inside a class to make it easier to include in my/your own<br />    programs.

				"content_html": "<p>Well, today is our last official day of vacation.  Tomorrow is a day of travel back to Dublin and then we wake up and head to the airport to see Kaia off to France and the rest of us to Chicago.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After our rain soaked day yesterday we were thrilled to wake up to see the sun and big puffy white clouds today. What a difference the sun makes!  Our departure this morning was slightly delayed as we were still drying shoes and clothing from yesterday, and (I suspect) because most of the group was in Roundstone partying at the pub until late last night.  The Miller family stayed and had dinner at the castle last night as we are all showing the wear of nearly four weeks on the road.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can&rsquo;t imagine what the maid must have though when she came into our room this morning.  I had been sitting on the floor drying 3 pairs of shoes with the blow drier; the shoes I&rsquo;ve worn every day for the last 3 weeks, Josh&rsquo;s tennis shoes, and Jane&rsquo;s walking shoes.  The smell was indescribable.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When we did take off we headed out toward Roundstone, a beautiful little seaside village which is becoming very popular among the well to do here in Ireland.  When you come into town you go right past the house of the guy who wrote the original River Dance. From Roundstone we made our way along the coast toward Ballyconeely where we had our first &lsquo;table stop&rsquo; of the day. Padraic was busy setting out a table with fruit and granola bars and juice for us.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We only had a little further to go to get to Clifden, so we decided to do the Sky Drive loop before lunch rather than after.  That turned out to be a great decision as the weather cooperated perfectly and we were treated to magnificent views of the sea.  Based on the color of the sea you would think that you were in the Caribbean not Ireland!  As you might guess the Sky drive was a bit of a climb but it takes you right out to a point where you can see ocean in three different directions. Here&rsquo;s the Miller family at our stop on the point.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course by this time our guides had already schemed to set up another table stop.  They had gone to the store in Clifden and bought some more Bulmers cider, this was the new berry flavor that Padraic had not had before so he was even more excited than usual for us to give it a try.  We toasted a great trip and all of our new found friends.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The ride back into Clifden was mostly downhill, but by this time we really were ready for some food.  We ate at E.J. Kings pub, Jane and I had the chicken curry, Kaia had ravioli, and Josh had a club sandwich.  I think Padraic was a little disappointed that we had strayed from traditional irish fare but by this time our palate&rsquo;s were ready for something a little more spicy.

				"content_text": "\n\nWell, today is our last official day of vacation.  Tomorrow is a day of travel back to Dublin and then we wake up and head to the airport to see Kaia off to France and the rest of us to Chicago.<br /><br />After our rain soaked day yesterday we were thrilled to wake up to see the sun and big puffy white clouds today. What a difference the sun makes!  Our departure this morning was slightly delayed as we were still drying shoes and clothing from yesterday, and (I suspect) because most of the group was in Roundstone partying at the pub until late last night.  The Miller family stayed and had dinner at the castle last night as we are all showing the wear of nearly four weeks on the road.  <br /><br />I can't imagine what the maid must have though when she came into our room this morning.  I had been sitting on the floor drying 3 pairs of shoes with the blow drier; the shoes I've worn every day for the last 3 weeks, Josh's tennis shoes, and Jane's walking shoes.  The smell was indescribable.<br /><br />When we did take off we headed out toward Roundstone, a beautiful little seaside village which is becoming very popular among the well to do here in Ireland.  When you come into town you go right past the house of the guy who wrote the original River Dance. From Roundstone we made our way along the coast toward Ballyconeely where we had our first 'table stop' of the day. Padraic was busy setting out a table with fruit and granola bars and juice for us.  <br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/1061.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_1061.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />We only had a little further to go to get to Clifden, so we decided to do the Sky Drive loop before lunch rather than after.  That turned out to be a great decision as the weather cooperated perfectly and we were treated to magnificent views of the sea.  Based on the color of the sea you would think that you were in the Caribbean not Ireland!  As you might guess the Sky drive was a bit of a climb but it takes you right out to a point where you can see ocean in three different directions. Here's the Miller family at our stop on the point.<br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/1062.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/07/01/s_1062.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />Of course by this time our guides had already schemed to set up another table stop.  They had gone to the store in Clifden and bought some more Bulmers cider, this was the new berry flavor that Padraic had not had before so he was even more excited than usual for us to give it a try.  We toasted a great trip and all of our new found friends.<br /><br />The ride back into Clifden was mostly downhill, but by this time we really were ready for some food.  We ate at E.J. Kings pub, Jane and I had the chicken curry, Kaia had ravioli, and Josh had a club sandwich.  I think Padraic was a little disappointed that we had strayed from traditional irish fare but by this time our palate's were ready for something a little more spicy.  We all had to laugh at Josh during lunch because we were talking about the weather and how lucky we were that it wasn't raining like it was yesterday.  I said yes, it only rains in Ireland on days that contain a 'y.'  Jane and Kaia laughed and the conversation moved on.  Suddenly, from out of the blue, Josh says, \"wait every day has a 'y' in it.\"  We still love him.  <br /><br />By the time we finished lunch it was almost 3:00 and it was time to head back to the Castle.  The Miller family took off a little ahead of the pack, and then Josh and I separated from Jane and Kaia, we made it back in record time.  It was our flattest ride yet.

We started off our day on the hop-on-hop-off tour bus.  Our first hop-off was at the Guinness storehouse.  This is a building that Guinness has turned into a monument to all things Guinness.  The building is designed so that your tour takes you around and around and on a spiral upward around the worlds largest Guinness pint glass.  We learned about how Guinness is brewed, about the history of Guinness, and how to pour the perfect pint of Guinness.  At the Gravity bar at the very top of the pint glass we were in an all glass circular room with great views of Dublin, there we could trade our ticket for&hellip;.. A pint of Guinness!  Here&rsquo;s Josh and I in front of the waterfall&hellip;good pure water is key to making Guinness.

We had some very nice pizzas and Kaia had a steaming hot bowl of Spaghetti Carbonara.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Kilmainham Gaol is a famous site in Dublin as it is the place where 14 of the 16 leaders of the Easter rebellion were executed.  It is a very old gaol and the history goes back well before the time of the potato famine in Ireland.  It was during the famine that the overcrowding at the gaol was at its worst.

We chose the Church bar, which is a bar/restaurant that has emerged from the remodeled Saint Mary&rsquo;s church in Dublin.  This is the first bar I&rsquo;ve been in that has its own pipe organ!  The pipe organ, built in the 18th century was used by G. F. Handel.  In addition there are several famous people who are buried in the church/pub, and there have been some important weddings including Alfred Guinness.  How appropriate to have a pint of Guinness in the place where he was married.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After happy hour and then dinner at Koh we were all ready to just kick back and watch the world cup match in our apartment while we finished up washing all of our clothes.  The match between Chile and Spain was a yawner, as chile seemed to be willing to place their hopes on Switzerland playing to a draw.  Its been very interesting traveling to all of the different companies during the world cup competition.  We have seen lots of different kinds of coverage and commentators.  Last night on Irish TV there were four  very old guys who spent forever dissecting the match and making the case that Spain was really going to have to pick up their game if they had any hope of progressing during the elimination round.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Today is a pretty light day.

Mr Guiness signed a 9000 year lease for the land on which the brewery sits in part because of it's access to the pure water flowing in from the Dublin Mountains.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/26/731.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/26/s_731.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />After the Guinness tour we hopped back on the bus and headed for the Gaol. By this time we were very hungry and so we decided to find a bit of lunch.  There was not much to choose from in the area around the Gaol but Dolce Vita caught our attention almost right away.  We had some very nice pizzas and Kaia had a steaming hot bowl of Spaghetti Carbonara.<br /><br />The Kilmainham Gaol is a famous site in Dublin as it is the place where 14 of the 16 leaders of the Easter rebellion were executed.  It is a very old gaol and the history goes back well before the time of the potato famine in Ireland.  It was during the famine that the overcrowding at the gaol was at its worst.  The gaol has been featured in several movies including Michael Connelly, and the original version of The Italian Job.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/26/732.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/26/s_732.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='210' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />By the time we had finished our guided tour of the gaol our feet were tired so we hopped back on the bus and rode it all the way around to where we had started.  Along the way we saw lots of other sites of Dublin.  The hop-on-hop-off busses are all double decker busses with open tops so we sat up top and enjoyed the scenery.<br /><br />We returned to our apartment for a little break and decided to head out to find a pub with internet access.  We chose the Church bar, which is a bar/restaurant that has emerged from the remodeled Saint Mary's church in Dublin.  This is the first bar I've been in that has its own pipe organ!  The pipe organ, built in the 18th century was used by G. F. Handel.  In addition there are several famous people who are buried in the church/pub, and there have been some important weddings including Alfred Guinness.  How appropriate to have a pint of Guinness in the place where he was married.<br /><br />After happy hour and then dinner at Koh we were all ready to just kick back and watch the world cup match in our apartment while we finished up washing all of our clothes.  The match between Chile and Spain was a yawner, as chile seemed to be willing to place their hopes on Switzerland playing to a draw.  Its been very interesting traveling to all of the different companies during the world cup competition.  We have seen lots of different kinds of coverage and commentators.  Last night on Irish TV there were four  very old guys who spent forever dissecting the match and making the case that Spain was really going to have to pick up their game if they had any hope of progressing during the elimination round.<br /><br />Today is a pretty light day.  We'll get in to Galway just after noon, and we don't have much planned other than some light walking around and scoping out somewhere to watch USA play tonight.  Josh and I are both wearing our USA jerseys today.  Good Luck team USA.<br /><br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=On%20the%20train%20from%20Dublin%20to%20Galway&z=10'>On the train from Dublin to Galway</a></p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-6269981965266059478?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

Here in Dublin we are staying in one of the StayDublin.com apartments.   Its a bit sketchy and in need of paint and a good cleaning but the apartment has two bedrooms a living room a kitchen with one of those funky european washer/dryer units.

We took a tour of Trinity College and saw the Book of Kells.  This is an amazingly old illuminated version of the four gospels that has been preserved by the Trinity library, its a really interesting exhibit, and we had a great guide who is a student at Trinity and works for Ark.com, Ark sells clothing and the idea is that every time you wear an article of Ark clothing you perform An Act of Random Kindness.

At the train stations there are bike racks two stories high, there are bike racks everywhere and people riding their bikes everywhere.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jane found Biking with Mike on the internet, he is a lifelong resident of Copenhagen who left his job as a director at a large company to do what he loves &ndash; bike and tell people about his city.  There is no fancy signup procedure as each days tours are first come first served.  If the weather is horrible there won&rsquo;t be a tour.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We left the ship at 9:30 and headed straight for Mike&rsquo;s bike shop.  We knew the tour was not until 10:30 but we wanted to make sure we got a spot on the tour.  We arrived by taxi 5 minutes later, but the shop did not even open until 10:00.  So we walked around the area a little bit and decided to get a coffee at the cafe up the block from Mike&rsquo;s.  One minor problem was that we hadn&rsquo;t taken the time to find a cash machine and get some Danish Kroners.  After preparing our coffee we discovered that the credit card reader in the coffee shop was not working properly, and so we were unable to pay.  In Decorah, this would not really be a problem, go find some money and pay me later.  Who would have guessed that we would find the same attitude in a big city?  This appears to be the Danish way.  The proprietor of the coffee shop was perfectly happy to have us go on our bike tour, get some cash, and pay him later in the day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shortly after 10 Mike arrived.  Bright green stocking hat, bright green shoes, a yellow and black livestrong vest and fashionable glasses.  His bike matched his cycling outfit.  Mike took us on a tour for a little over 3 hours.  We saw the palace, the castle, the parliament buildings, the house where Hans Christian Anderson was born, the new opera house, a couple of parks, and a little lawless place called Christiana.  We would bike for a while and then stop and mike would give us a short lecture on what were were looking at, Danish politics, Danish culture, local gossip, you name it and MIke knew about it.  He is an excellent story teller.  As we were riding there was no talking, the idea is to absorb the local feeling of the place as you are riding rather than chatting.  It worked.  It was fun, we saw a lot of the city.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Christiana was the most interesting stop on the tour.  We had coffee in the moonshine cafe.  It is the safest coffee house in Copenhagen. Why?  The sign on the door tells the story.  More than 6000 police inspections since 2004.  Christiana is the counter culture area of Copenhagen, Mike discouraged us from taking any pictures in the area because you never know when you might accidentally capture a deal going down, and they don&rsquo;t like that.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We learned one word of Danish that really sums up our Copenhagen experience.  The word is Hygglite, it is difficult to describe exactly what it means, cozy is one possible translation while fantastic is another.  Internet people might translate it as &ldquo;A Good Thing.&rdquo;  Its a word they use in Denmark to describe when something is just right and good.  Our bike tour of Copenhagen with mike was definitely Hygglite.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the conclusion of our tour we paid mike and headed, on foot, back through the park on the way to the ship.  When we emerged from the park, there was Mike on his bike.  Hello he said, I wonder if you might have a few minute to talk to a reporter from the paper Politik?  Its the largest Danish paper and they are doing a story about touring copenhagen on bike.  It seems that the reporter for the paper was planning to go on Mike&rsquo;s afternoon tour, but because of the oncoming rain Mike had cancelled the afternoon tour.  So, we agreed to spend a few minutes talking to the reporter and then we got our picture taken by one of the photographers from the paper.  So, if you speak Danish you can read about the Miller family and our bike fun in the city of Copenhagen!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Copenhagen, Denmark<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

There is no fancy signup procedure as each days tours are first come first served.  If the weather is horrible there won't be a tour.  <br /><br />We left the ship at 9:30 and headed straight for Mike's bike shop.  We knew the tour was not until 10:30 but we wanted to make sure we got a spot on the tour.  We arrived by taxi 5 minutes later, but the shop did not even open until 10:00.  So we walked around the area a little bit and decided to get a coffee at the cafe up the block from Mike's.  One minor problem was that we hadn't taken the time to find a cash machine and get some Danish Kroners.  After preparing our coffee we discovered that the credit card reader in the coffee shop was not working properly, and so we were unable to pay.  In Decorah, this would not really be a problem, go find some money and pay me later.  Who would have guessed that we would find the same attitude in a big city?  This appears to be the Danish way.  The proprietor of the coffee shop was perfectly happy to have us go on our bike tour, get some cash, and pay him later in the day.<br /><br />Shortly after 10 Mike arrived.  Bright green stocking hat, bright green shoes, a yellow and black livestrong vest and fashionable glasses.  His bike matched his cycling outfit.  Mike took us on a tour for a little over 3 hours.  We saw the palace, the castle, the parliament buildings, the house where Hans Christian Anderson was born, the new opera house, a couple of parks, and a little lawless place called Christiana.  We would bike for a while and then stop and mike would give us a short lecture on what were were looking at, Danish politics, Danish culture, local gossip, you name it and MIke knew about it.  He is an excellent story teller.  As we were riding there was no talking, the idea is to absorb the local feeling of the place as you are riding rather than chatting.  It worked.  It was fun, we saw a lot of the city.<br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/439.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/s_439.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />Christiana was the most interesting stop on the tour.  We had coffee in the moonshine cafe.  It is the safest coffee house in Copenhagen. Why?  The sign on the door tells the story.  More than 6000 police inspections since 2004.  Christiana is the counter culture area of Copenhagen, Mike discouraged us from taking any pictures in the area because you never know when you might accidentally capture a deal going down, and they don't like that.<br /><br />We learned one word of Danish that really sums up our Copenhagen experience.  The word is Hygglite, it is difficult to describe exactly what it means, cozy is one possible translation while fantastic is another.  Internet people might translate it as \"A Good Thing.\"  Its a word they use in Denmark to describe when something is just right and good.  Our bike tour of Copenhagen with mike was definitely Hygglite.<br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/440.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/21/s_440.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br />At the conclusion of our tour we paid mike and headed, on foot, back through the park on the way to the ship.  When we emerged from the park, there was Mike on his bike.  Hello he said, I wonder if you might have a few minute to talk to a reporter from the paper Politik?  Its the largest Danish paper and they are doing a story about touring copenhagen on bike.  It seems that the reporter for the paper was planning to go on Mike's afternoon tour, but because of the oncoming rain Mike had cancelled the afternoon tour.  So, we agreed to spend a few minutes talking to the reporter and then we got our picture taken by one of the photographers from the paper.  So, if you speak Danish you can read about the Miller family and our bike fun in the city of Copenhagen!<br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Copenhagen,%20Denmark&z=10'>Copenhagen, Denmark</a></p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-2200921901605184937?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

We are at the Hotel Thon, it is on the end of Byrggen Street, right across the road from the harbor.  Its a very nice location, except that it is next to a huge city park.  What is wrong with that you may ask.  Well, it turns out that we picked the wrong night to stay at the Thon hotel next to the park, as tonight is the night of the Rammstein concert.  Who are Rammstein you may ask? After a little internet searching I quickly learned that Rammstein are a German industrial metal band.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We are actually on the opposite side of the hotel from the concert but at the moment it is making no difference.  We are trying to watch the world cup, but the sound from the concert is so loud it is drowning out the Brazilian national anthem.

We started our tour of Bergen by meeting one of Kaia&rsquo;s facebook friends named Thomas at our hotel.  Thomas had visited Decorah with a group of Norwegian students a couple of years ago, and volunteered to get us oriented to the city when he saw Kaia&rsquo;s Facebook status.  He showed us around the area including the wharf and the fish market and the central park of Bergen.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jane and Kaia spent some time shopping around the city for a sweater for Kaia.

We took Thomas' recommendation for a restaurant for supper tonight and went to Egon&rsquo;s.  It is a Norwegian chain restaurant and the food was OK.

We are at the Hotel Thon, it is on the end of Byrggen Street, right across the road from the harbor.  Its a very nice location, except that it is next to a huge city park.  What is wrong with that you may ask.  Well, it turns out that we picked the wrong night to stay at the Thon hotel next to the park, as tonight is the night of the Rammstein concert.  Who are Rammstein you may ask? After a little internet searching I quickly learned that Rammstein are a German industrial metal band.  <br /><br />We are actually on the opposite side of the hotel from the concert but at the moment it is making no difference.  We are trying to watch the world cup, but the sound from the concert is so loud it is drowning out the Brazilian national anthem.  I would much prefer the sounds of those dumb world cup horns to the sound of a german industrial metal band.  We can only hope that the concert will wrap up at a respectable time.  Josh just found a view of the concert and said it looks like a bunch of black ants (yes all the concert goers are dressed in black T-shirts) streaming toward a rotting apple.<br /><br />OK, enough grousing, Bergen really is a nice city.  We started our tour of Bergen by meeting one of Kaia's facebook friends named Thomas at our hotel.  Thomas had visited Decorah with a group of Norwegian students a couple of years ago, and volunteered to get us oriented to the city when he saw Kaia's Facebook status.  He showed us around the area including the wharf and the fish market and the central park of Bergen.<br /><br />Jane and Kaia spent some time shopping around the city for a sweater for Kaia.  They were successful, and so Kaia can proudly celebrate her heritage at concord, and at Christmas time.<br /><br />We took the Funicular up high above the city this afternoon and the view is amazing.  We took Thomas' recommendation for a restaurant for supper tonight and went to Egon's.  It is a Norwegian chain restaurant and the food was OK.  I think we have officially reached the point of vacation where choosing a place to eat for supper and dinner in a new strange city has become somewhat of a chore.  We miss the home cooking.<br /><br /><br /><br /><center><a href='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/15/1174.jpg'><img src='http://blogpress.w18.net/photos/10/06/15/s_1174.jpg' border='0' width='281' height='187' style='margin:5px'></a></center><br /><br />Tomorrow morning we have another fairly early morning, as we must be on board our ferry boat at 8 AM for the trip to Balestrand, of course early morning takes on a whole new connotation at this time of the year at this latitude.   We are now far enough north that there is only a couple hours of darkness at this time of the year.  Darkness is only from midnight until a little after 2 AM.  The Ferry trip tomorrow promises to be a beautiful trip through the fjords, we are all looking forward to it very much.<br /><br />For now we are resting and watching Brazil and the People's Republic of Korea play some football.<br /><br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Bergen,%20Norway&z=10'>Bergen, Norway</a></p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7886036605437936476?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

It rolled, broke to the right and dropped straight into the cup.   Here&rsquo;s where the story gets really weird, two holes later, Josh also got a hole in one.

This time we were in Edinburgh Scotland watching USA play England.  Now before you get too worried about us cheering for our side on the home turf of our opponent let me just clarify that when England is playing the Scottish will cheer very loudly for the other team!  As soon as we arrived in Edinburgh Josh. Changed into his USA jersey, and as we were waking around Edinburgh he got lots of comments from the locals.  &ldquo;nice top there son&rdquo;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So it came to pass that we found ourselves in a hotel bar with lots of support for USA.  On one side was a group of about 20 younger scottish men, and on the other were some additional tourists like ourselves.  We had hoped to experience the game in a pub, but unfortunately they do not allow minors after 8pm.  It was great fun to watch the game here, but I must say that I have grown used to the expert commentary of my friend Jim, who is leading a group of Luther alumni on a trip through Germany at the moment.  I am sure Jim found a good place to watch the game there with some German support.  You see all kinds of people when you watch the game in a hotel bar.  At one point an Asian man came in, and stared at the screen for a couple of minutes before asking &ldquo;what half is it?&rdquo;. One of our scottish compatriots replied, well I don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re from mate but when the clock says forty two minutes here you&rsquo;re in the first half.  It sounds even funnier when you hear it with the accent.  Needless to say that particular fan did not stick around to watch much of the game.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When the Americans scored (yes it was an error on the English keeper) the whole bar erupted in cheers and then a chant of USA USA started up.  The bar manager looked like he couldn&rsquo;t decide what to do.  He clearly wanted to  calm everyone down and was obviously worried that a riot was going to break out in his bar.   But he had no idea how what the right strategy was.  In the end order was restored by some humor.  After the cheers erupted and the chant had started one of the scottish fans came running back into the room to see what all of the commotion was about.  As he had been in the toilet, he made a great show of zipping up his zipper which put everyone to laughing, including the manager.  Although I was disappointed to settle for the draw, I think it is a good result for the American side. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Earlier in the day we did spend some time walking around Edinburgh, we walked the Royal Mile, and checked out Holyrood House.  We have now seen all the royal residences except for Balmoral.  The big story of Holyrood is that this is where Mary Queen of Scots spent a lot of time, and it is also where her young son was killed right before her eyes by her husband.

It was fun, everyone was trying new stuff that was a little out of the comfort zone for a bunch of midwesterners.</p><br /><br /><div style=\"text-align:center;\"><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7323b24e5f.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_0045.JPG\" border=\"0\" width=\"800\"  /></div><br /><br /><p>The words of the day are \"stalking\" and \"audacious.\"  This seemed to be a theme from many people in terms of both job hiring and job seeking.</p><br /><br /><p>I'll update this initial post to include the blogs the students are writing:</p><br /><br /><ul><br /><li><a href=\"http://blog.drewbaumann.com\">Drew Baumann</a></li><br /><li><a href=\"http://megynsays.blogspot.com\">Megan Hallberg</a></li><br /><li><a href=\"http://kifluarega.blogspot.com/\">Kiflu Arega</a></li><br /><li><a href=\"http://uhlebr01.blogspot.com/\">Bryan Uhlenhake</a></li><br /><li><a href=\"http://jeniarbuckle.blogspot.com/\">Jeni Arbuckle</a></li><br /><li><a href=\"http://kaitshow.blogspot.com\">Kaitlin Showalter</a></li><br /><li><a href=\"http://aarongauthier.blogspot.com/\">Aaron Gauthier</a></li><br /><li><a href=\"http://adampyz.blogspot.com/\">Adam Pyzdrowski</a></li><br /><li><a href=\"jottesili.blogspot.com\">Jacob Otte</a></li><br /></ul><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-6824108243673172284?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>This morning started out like any other morning.  The alarm went off at 6:15 so that we could get up and get on our way to the everglades.  We left the Embassy Suites and walked down 17th Avenue toward the intercostal waterway where we were picking up our rental car.  On the way we split our forces with half of us going to Einstein&rsquo;s Bagel Shop and half to Starbucks for Tea, Chai Latte and Cocoa.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We beat the traffic heading out of town easily on our way to the Sawgrass recreation park.  It is part of the Everglades national park.  We had an appointment with Captain Randy and his airboat at 8:00.  Our instructions were to meet him 1/2 mile past mile marker 38 on highway 27.  We got there early, the sun was still pretty low in the sky and finished our breakfast in the small parking lot.  A few minutes later a pickup truck pulling an airboat with seating for nine pulled into the lot.  We watched as the captain fired up the 500 horsepower Corvette engine hooked up to a four blade airline propellor.  After the short checkout period he backed the boat and trailor into the water and brought the boat around to the ground.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We greeted Captain Randy, who showed us onto the boat and gave us a short intro to our safety equipment, which consisted of headphones to protect our eardrums from the sound of the engine and airplane prop.  He invited one of us to join him in the topmost pair of seats as the co-pilot.  We took off, and after a short lesson in steering the airboat, push forward for right and pull back for left, he turned the steering over to me.  Driving an airboat takes a lot more anticipation than driving a ski boat.  When you want to turn a corner on one of the trails in the everglades you need to start doing so a few seconds in advance.  Luckily if you cut the corner to sharp, or too late you really don&rsquo;t run into any problems.  You make the trail a little wider as you mow down the Sawgrass and cattail, but there seems to be enough of both to go around.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Taking the early morning trip was a great idea as the angle of the sun was just beautiful, and we saw hundreds of birds as we cruised through the trails.  We saw hawks, and herons, and vultures and birds of all different colors and varieties.   In addition to the birds we were always on the lookout for gators.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Captain Randy seems to have come from a long line of Everglades boat captains that have been involved with all kinds of dubious activities.  Pappy was an alligator poacher, and Randy and his brother kept small alligators as pets when they were younger.  As Captain Randy fed one of the gators along the way hotdogs and marshmallows he informed us that feeding the gators was strictly against the law.  That didn&rsquo;t stop him, and we got some great pictures of Randy feeding his Mi Amoure Catalyna.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shortly after our gator feeding experience, we reached the farthest point on our tour.  By this point we were all pretty comfortable with the boat and so I was sitting in the bow taking pictures and the rest of the family was comfortably spread around.  Randy headed the boat down a narrow trail and suddenly I noticed that we were boating in mud instead of water.  As the mud got thicker and drier the boat went slower and slower until we finally came to a halt.  Stuck in the mud!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After trying to gun the giant engine on our airboat for many minutes Randy finally admitted that we were stuck and going to need some help getting out.  At this point we learned a couple of things about Randy&rsquo;s friend Lyle.  First, Lyle had an extremely long message on his business phone, and his cell phone.  Second we learned that Randy had helped Lyle out of a similar situation just a couple of days ago.  After failing to reach Lyle by phone we resorted to the old fashioned VHF radio.  &ldquo;Laxahatchie, Laxahatcie, Laxahatchie, Lyle this is Randy are you there, over&hellip;.&rdquo;  With those words our 3-hour tour became a rescue mission.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Our airboat was partway down a trail that had been drained of water.  We were about 150 feet onto the mud and it looked like the mud continued for another 300 before it rounded a bend.  The trick was to turn the airboat around and pull it out the short way.  Unfortunately in the Everglades walking on mud is not so easy.  When Randy got out of the boat to try and use a rope to turn us around he sunk up nearly to his waist.  To get back to the edge of the water required him to crawl on hands and knees to distribute his weight.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The four of us stayed in the boat feeling somewhat amused at our situation.  Clearly we were not in any sort of life threatening emergency but for Randy this was clearly a pain in the butt and probably somewhat of an embarrasment.  We were not dressed to jump in the mud and help him, although Kaia seemed very willing to do so.  Josh was protecting his new green and white Nikes that Grandpa Miller bought him for Christmas but other than that I think he would have helped too.   I had on a brand new pair of Tommy Bahama shorts that I was definitely not interested in getting covered in Everglades mud.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The rescuue mission was long and tedious as Lyle&rsquo;s big boat could not turn around at the end of our trail.  This required the help of a third airboat driven by a kind stranger.  The third boat acted as  a tug boat getting Lyle in the proper position and ferrying the rope into Randy when necessary.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The procedure that Randy and Lyle determined for getting us out involved tieing a line to the bow of the boat and then pulling with Lyle&rsquo;s larger airboat.  To a physicist this seemed like a dumb idea as the angles involved were all wrong, but neither Randy or Lyle were physicists so this was not an issue.  After breaking Randy&rsquo;s bowline there was some thought that the way to resolve the issue would be to bring a couple of pieces of plywood so that the tourists would be able to walk out of the trail but going from plank to plank and moving the planks as we made progress.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Walking the tourists out was not an acceptable plan to Captain Randy.   It was clear that Lyle&rsquo;s larger rope needed to be connected directly to the bow of our airboat and then threaded through the side of the boat about halfway back.  Randy decided that he would get to the side with a second rope and pull to try and provide the needed force vector to get the boat to turn to the side.  After several long pulls we finally had the boat turned at a ninty degree angle to our original course.  (This only took about three hours to get us to this position).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We repositioned the rope to the bow of Randy&rsquo;s ship and he got in his captains chair.  At this point the plan was to have one last pull by Lyle with Randy ready to &ldquo;Give her Hell&rdquo; as soon as we were headed in roughly the right direction.  With this plan in mind and one last pull we were finally free!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Once free of the mud we followed Lyle back to his docking area where hugs were exchanged and many thumbs up were given to our kind helpers.   By this time Captain Randy had completely missed his 11:30 trip and was wanting to make sure we got back to the landing in time to meet his 2:30.  So we took off for home base at high speed.  After a while he slowed down so that Jane or Josh could drive.  Josh wanted to have nothing to do with driving as by this time he was convinced that he would do something even worse than get us stuck in the mud.  So Jane took her turn and did a great job of driving the boat.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just before we got back to the landing we made one last stop with captain Randy to make sure that we had our stories straight.  Clearly he was a little nervous that his muddy appearance might be offputting to his next group.  Particularly if we were unhappy and complaining about the trip.  He really had no reason to worry, all of us thought the trip was a great adventure.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After our exciting airboat trip we planned to stop at the Sawgrass Mill, an enormous shopping center.  It took us almost a half hour of driving around to find the Ron Jon outlet store.  Even after we found it it took forever to get in because the parking lot was so busy and full.  The plan was for us to stop there to get Kaia a swimming suit.  Since I had discovered that my old suit was too big for me I decided to get one too.  Josh also found himself a nice suit and a football for using in the water.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The next big surprise of the night came when we walked over to Pazzo&rsquo;s for an italian dinner.  We walked in the door and talked to the hostess who told us to wait just a minute as she checked the tables.  As we stood waiting for a minute a familiar figure came across the bar headed toward us.  Sasan Mokhtari and his family were in the restaurant!  they were in town for the soccer tournament.  It was really fun to reconnect with Sasan after several years.  We had a great talk with Sasan and Mary and their kids Tara, Eva, and Daniel.  Tara is a first year at MIT and Eva and Daniel have transferred to Breck.   It took Sasan only about 3 minutes to ask me if I would be interested in doing some consulting for him!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We had a great meal, although Josh was feeling a little sick and didn&rsquo;t eat very much.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n",

We walked in the door and talked to the hostess who told us to wait just a minute as she checked the tables.  As we stood waiting for a minute a familiar figure came across the bar headed toward us.  Sasan Mokhtari and his family were in the restaurant!  they were in town for the soccer tournament.  It was really fun to reconnect with Sasan after several years.  We had a great talk with Sasan and Mary and their kids Tara, Eva, and Daniel.  Tara is a first year at MIT and Eva and Daniel have transferred to Breck.   It took Sasan only about 3 minutes to ask me if I would be interested in doing some consulting for him!<br /><br />We had a great meal, although Josh was feeling a little sick and didn't eat very much.<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7763680025059074412?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

It turns out the emacsen have been busysince I've been using TextMate.  Aquamacs 2.0 is a great Cocoa port ofEmacs 23.  Not sure whether I should call it a port since emacsofficially supports the OS X operating system.The first thing I did was check out some of the old modes I used touse.  AucTeX, GNUs are both packaged with emacs now.   The SQL mode that comes withis great and \"just works\" with mysql and postgresql. There is goodsupport for Python and of course HTML. Two minor gliches in thoseareas that I wish I could fix:<ul><li>I cannot get MMM (multi-major-mode) to work properly.  I wouldreally like to have both HTML and Javascript colorized properly whenI'm working on my Django projects.  If anyone has any advice ongetting MMM to work right in emacs 23 I would really appreciate apointer.</li><li>Completion in iPython does not work right.  Instead of completingin the ipython shell it just indents more.</li></ul>In addition to some old friends I discovered a bunch of new modes thatare really nice.  JDE for Java development, Muse for creating lecturenotes in a personal wiki style.  In addition Muse lets you publish amarkup style format really easily in lots of differnt output formats.I've been a big fan of using Pandoc with TextMate over the last fewyears, but Muse is every bit as nice.One thing lacking in Muse was the ability to quickly bold or ital ortt some part of the text I'm working on.  So I decided to dust off mylisp coding ability and cook up my own.  The result is shown below.  Ithink it is a nice example of a lot of what you need to do in writingbasic lisp extensions for any text processing mode.  I'd be happy toget comments on how to improve this.The idea of these simple commands is that pressing cmd-b should boldthe word the cursor is currently on, or the region (if there is one)or simply insert **|** when the cursor is not on a word.   It alsotook some research to figure out how to bind a function to the commandkey. (side note: I've finally gotten comfortable with using the optionkey for meta in emacs.)<br /><br /><pre style=\"overflow:auto;\" class=\"prettyprint lang-el\"><br />(defun muse-bold-word ()<br />  (interactive)<br />  (muse-wrap-with-string \"**\" 2)<br />)<br /><br />(defun muse-ital-word ()<br />  (interactive)<br />  (muse-wrap-with-string \"*\" 1)<br />)<br /><br />(defun muse-tt-word () <br />  (interactive)<br />  (muse-wrap-with-string \"=\" 1)<br />)<br /><br />(defun muse-wrap-with-string (str len)<br />  (if mark-active<br />      (progn<br /> (kill-region (point) (mark))<br /> (let ((myword (car kill-ring)))<br />   (insert (concat str myword str) )))<br />    (let ((myStr (thing-at-point 'word)))<br />      (if myStr<br />   (let ((myBounds (bounds-of-thing-at-point 'word)))<br />     (kill-region (car myBounds) (cdr myBounds))<br />     (insert (concat str myStr str)))<br /> (progn<br />   (insert (concat str str))<br />   (goto-char (- (point) len)) ) ) ))<br />)<br /><br />(define-key muse-mode-map `[(,osxkeys-command-key b)] 'muse-bold-word)<br />(define-key muse-mode-map `[(,osxkeys-command-key i)] 'muse-ital-word)<br />(define-key muse-mode-map `[(,osxkeys-command-key k)] 'muse-tt-word)<br /><br /></pre>    </div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-7610258374161196053?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_text": "\n\nFor three days we had a great raft trip with Wilderness River Adventures.  The trip was amazing!  For three days we saw the Grand Canyon in a way that few are lucky enough to see, from the bottom up.  As we rafted along we literally saw the history of the world from today to 2 billion years ago.  The beauty of this place is just awe inspiring.<br /><br />We began our trip at Lee's Ferry, just south of Page Arizona and ended up at Phantom Ranch at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.  We shared the trip with another small group (Rocky, Joe, and Denise) and one large group from Lafayette College.  <br /><br />The Lafeyette group really made the trip for us.  The group of Geology students was led by Dr. Larry Malinconico (Dr. M) and Dr. Dave Sunderlin.  In my slightly biased opinion I thought that Luther students were the friendliest students anywhere.  The group from Lafeyette taught me that there are other colleges with really great students.  Not only did we learn a lot from lurking in the back of the impromptu lectures but we had a great time getting to know them all.<br /><br />Here are a couple of examples of how beautiful the canyon is.

				"content_text": "\n<p>In the past year, I've been a passionate supporter of three task management apps.  OmniFocus, Things, and Remember The Milk (RTM).  I've switched back and forth between them trying to decide which one works best for me.  I think I'm finally ready to commit to RTM as my long term solution and here's why.</p><p>All three apps have an iPhone component and a desktop component. Although the primary RTM interface on the desktop is through the browser there are plenty of Widgets and other desktop friendly ways to access RTM on the desktop.  What I really like about RTM for the desktop is its openness.  In terms of the ability to dump stuff into RTM its cloud computing model really works.</p><p>With both OmniFocus and Things I have to be on the same subnet as my laptop in order for the wifi syncing between my Ipod Touch and the desktop to work.  Unfortunately outside of my house this is rarely the case.  With RTM I can be anywhere.  That means I'm free to roam anywhere in the world with my iPod Touch and I know that when I dump a task or note into RTM it will be there on my desktop or the web interface when I come back to it.  If I forget my iPod Touch (a very unlikely event) I can still dump tasks into RTM from any browser.</p><p>The second thing I really like about RTM is its openness.  As you can see from my posts below I have developed my own desktop interface to RTM using the Python bindings and LaunchBar.  The three things that I want to do most often, with as little fuss as possible are: </p><ul><br /><li>Add a task</li><br /><li>Mark a task as complete</li><br /><li>display tasks</li><br /></ul><p>With my LaunchBar integration I don't ever have to take my fingers off the keyboard to do any of those tasks.</p><p>When I'm using my iPod Touch, I think that the RTM client is the best and most fully featured of the bunch.  Since RTM has been around as a service for longer than either Things or OmniFocus they have had more time to work on polishing their iApp.  It already supports tagging and searching.  Things that are coming in the other apps but are already here for RTM on the iPod today.</p><p>Because RTM has an open API there are lots of other nice interfaces for you to use that make it easy to dump tasks and notes into your inbox.  Do you Twitter?  Send a direct message to your RTM inbox.  Do you Text?  Send using the Twitter RTM gateway you can text directly to your inbox.  Email? yes.  You can even email a whole list of stuff to RTM as a way to quickly import a long list of tasks or packing items you have copied from somewhere else. Jott, yes.  The possibilities are endless and expanding all the time.</p><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-8362482726254033567?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "\n<h3>Intro</h3><br />Once I could add tasks to my RTM account through LaunchBar I wanted a way to quickly pull up a view of what tasks were due today through LaunchBar.  The Growl library provides a nice way of doing this.<br /><br />The overview is as follows:  Activate LaunchBar and type due.  This due is installed as a search shortcut and you can search for today, tomorrow, or all (abbreviations are also easy).  The search shortcut runs the python script that searches your tasks on Remember the Milk.  For each task it finds it puts up a sticky Growl notification so you get a nice list of tasks on your screen.  You could easily customize the script to put all the tasks in a single notification but I like them separate.<br /><br />Since the Growl module registers this script as an application you can also use the Growl Preference Pane to customize the look and feel or even the location of your notifications.  You can also customize whether you want the notifications to be sticky or not.<br /><br /><h3>The Code</h3><br />Here is the code for doing all of this.  It makes use of the filter parameter on getList.<br /><br /><pre><br />#!/usr/bin/env python<br /><br />from rtm import *<br />import sys<br />import Growl<br /><br />def sendNotify(ts):<br />    if type(ts.task) == list:<br />        for j in range(len(ts.task)):<br />            notifier.notify(\"today\",\"Task Due: \"+ts.task[j].due[:10],ts.name,sticky=True)<br />    else:<br />        notifier.notify(\"today\",\"Task Due: \"+ts.task.due[:10],ts.name,sticky=True)<br /><br />if len(sys.argv) == 2:<br />    command = sys.argv[1]<br />else:<br />    command = \"today\"<br /><br />apiKey = \"get your own\"<br />secret = \"this too\"<br />token = \"You will create this\"<br /><br />name = \"RTMDue\"<br />notifications = [\"today\",\"tomorrow\"]<br />notifier = Growl.GrowlNotifier(name,notifications)<br />notifier.register()<br /><br />if command[:3] == \"tod\" or command == '':<br />    cutoff = 'today'<br />elif command[:3] == \"tom\":<br />    cutoff = 'tomorrow'<br />else:<br />    cutoff = None <br /><br />rtm = createRTM(apiKey, secret, token)<br /><br />if cutoff:<br />    filterString = 'status:incomplete and (due:%s or dueBefore:%s)'%(cutoff,cutoff)<br />else:<br />    filterString = 'status:incomplete'<br /><br />theTasks = rtm.tasks.getList(filter=filterString)<br /><br />if type(theTasks.tasks.list) == list:<br />    for i in range(len(theTasks.tasks.list)):<br />        if type(theTasks.tasks.list[i].taskseries) == list:<br />            for j in range(len(theTasks.tasks.list[i].taskseries)):<br />                ts = theTasks.tasks.list[i].taskseries[j]<br />                sendNotify(ts)<br />        else:<br />            ts = theTasks.tasks.list[i].taskseries<br />            sendNotify(ts)<br />else:<br />    if type(theTasks.tasks.list.taskseries) == list:<br />        for i in range(len(theTasks.tasks.list.taskseries)):<br />            ts = theTasks.tasks.list.taskseries[i]<br />            sendNotify(ts)<br />    else:<br />        ts = theTasks.tasks.list.taskseries<br />        sendNotify(ts)<br /><br /></pre><br /><br /><h3>Next Steps</h3><br />It would be great if I can figure out a way to have the Growl notification box call a script to mark the task as done.  Feel free to leave comments or suggestions or improvements in the comments.<br /><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2759017781463016019-8714853411033992279?l=blog.bonelakesoftware.com' alt='' /></div>\n",

The obelisk weighed 300 metric tons and 500 romans showed up\nto help move the obelisk. thousands of romans showed up to watch and the\npope swore everyone to silence under pain of death so that the workmen\ncould concentrate.

Nevertheless Having Sandra\nas our guide turned out to be great. We learned a lot from her about the\nthings that we stopped to see.

				"title": "Mamma Mia We are in Pompei",
				"content_html": "<h1 id=\"mamma-mia-we-are-in-pompei\">Mamma Mia We are in Pompei</h1>\n<p>This morning dawned bright and sunny. Once again the view of the Bay of\nNaples from our deck was spectacular. As we were eating breakfast we saw\na cruise ship coming into the harboor. it looked like they would be\ntendering directly into Sorrento.</p>\n<p>We got up early so we could meet our guide for a tour of Pompei. We\narrived at Pompei right at 8:30, purchased our tickets, and looked for\nour guide. It turned out that we were looking for her in the wrong\nplace. She was at the Camping Zeus parking lot (where we parked) and we\nwere at the gate.</p>\n<p>Our guides name was Patricia (Pah Tree tsee aah). She gave us a very\ngood tour and turned out to be very quotable.</p>\n<p>Moma Mia its hot! Moma Mia we must get away from the enemy (the other\ntourists)</p>\n<p>Pompei was hot and busy even though we were some of the first people in\nline for tickets. But it was still very interesting and a fun tour\nagain. It was even better after having read Harrison&rsquo;s book about\nPompei.</p>\n<dl>\n<dt>Highlights of Pompei</dt>\n<dd>\n<ul>\n<li>theater</li>\n<li>the baths</li>\n<li>houses</li>\n</ul>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p>After the tour Patricia gave us a lunch recommendation for a restaurant\nright near the Cameo factory we had visited five years ago. She\nintroduced us as her friends to the Maitre De and told him to take good\ncare of us. We got off to a very good start when Jane asked for a Coke\nLight and he responded that they had Pepsi! Our first Diet Pepsi in many\ndays! After that the rest of the lunch, Napoli style pizza was really\nirrelevant.</p>\n<p>We walked around a few of the shops and then headed for our car. We knew\nwe were a little ahead of schedule but there really was not time for any\nadditional touring if we wanted to be in Rome by 5:00.</p>\n<p>Thankfully I had been able to follow the directions the guy at Renault\ngave me and programmed in the right location for the drop off. It was in\nthe same area as the airport but was next to a cow pasture! The office\nseemed to be some kind of cheap warehouse space they had rented with a\nbit of covered parking for the returned vehicles. After we inspected our\ncar and signed over the lease the attendant drove us to the airport and\ndropped us off near the taxi line.</p>\n<p>We headed for the start of the taxi queue and were met by a driver who\ntold us it would be 90 euros for a ride downtown for all four of us with\nour luggage. That was much higher than we expected so we went inside to\nregroup and try to learn about the Rome shuttle service we had read\nabout. We finally gave up and decided to pay the 90 dollars to just get\ngoing. On our way to the line we ran into a driver who told us he would\ntake us for 65 euros. He appeared to be wearing a taxi drivers license\naround his neck, but he took us to the parking lot rather than the taxi\nline. We were really wondering if this guy was legit but he got us\ndowntown in just 35 minutes for the agreed on price.</p>\n<p>Our hotel, Albergo Santa Chiara, is right behind the Pantheon. When we\nchecked in, the two managers were looking at us and their list of\ncustomers and speaking angrily as if to say &lsquo;what are we going to do\nwith them?&rsquo; I think it worked in our favor as they gave us one of their\nthree apartments. We have a main room with TV and two pull out beds, a\nmiddle room with another bed, bathroom, and kitchen. However the porter\ntold us &ldquo;chicken is locked.&rdquo; Finally, we have a master bedroom. So we\nhave a great room for our last three nights of touring.</p>\n<p>We all agreed that we were really really tired of pasta and heavy\nitalian food. Unfortunately we did not have our Rick Steve&rsquo;s book nor\nhad we asked at the front desk about alternative food sources. So we\nsettled for walking to Piazza Navonna to see what they had. We found a\nrestaurant that offered hamburgers and chicken along with traditional\nitalian food.</p>\n<p>As we were sitting at our table waiting for service Kaia noticed a man\ndrawing caricatures in the middle of the piazza. She went to talk to the\nguy who told her he would draw both of them for 20 euros. So, while we\nwaited for our food Josh and Kaia each had a caricature drawn. They are\nboth very good. Josh is a soccer player and Kaia is a runner.</p>\n<p>Since we were seated on the outside table right next the the main\ntraffic around the Piazza we were inundated with sales people trying to\nsell us flowers, and all kinds of glowing and buzzing things. In\naddition we had fun watching the people selling scarves and fake Prada\npurses playing cat and mouse with the two police officers patrolling the\npiazza. Everytime they would get their bags arranged on the side walk we\nwould suddenly see a wave of them scooping up bags and heading down the\nsidewalk. Followed by one of the officers.

As we were eating breakfast we saw\na cruise ship coming into the harboor. it looked like they would be\ntendering directly into Sorrento.\n\nWe got up early so we could meet our guide for a tour of Pompei. We\narrived at Pompei right at 8:30, purchased our tickets, and looked for\nour guide. It turned out that we were looking for her in the wrong\nplace. She was at the Camping Zeus parking lot (where we parked) and we\nwere at the gate.\n\nOur guides name was Patricia (Pah Tree tsee aah). She gave us a very\ngood tour and turned out to be very quotable.\n\nMoma Mia its hot! Moma Mia we must get away from the enemy (the other\ntourists)\n\nPompei was hot and busy even though we were some of the first people in\nline for tickets. But it was still very interesting and a fun tour\nagain. It was even better after having read Harrison's book about\nPompei.\n\nHighlights of Pompei\n\n:   -   theater\n    -   the baths\n    -   houses\n\nAfter the tour Patricia gave us a lunch recommendation for a restaurant\nright near the Cameo factory we had visited five years ago. She\nintroduced us as her friends to the Maitre De and told him to take good\ncare of us. We got off to a very good start when Jane asked for a Coke\nLight and he responded that they had Pepsi! Our first Diet Pepsi in many\ndays! After that the rest of the lunch, Napoli style pizza was really\nirrelevant.\n\nWe walked around a few of the shops and then headed for our car. We knew\nwe were a little ahead of schedule but there really was not time for any\nadditional touring if we wanted to be in Rome by 5:00.\n\nThankfully I had been able to follow the directions the guy at Renault\ngave me and programmed in the right location for the drop off. It was in\nthe same area as the airport but was next to a cow pasture! The office\nseemed to be some kind of cheap warehouse space they had rented with a\nbit of covered parking for the returned vehicles. After we inspected our\ncar and signed over the lease the attendant drove us to the airport and\ndropped us off near the taxi line.\n\nWe headed for the start of the taxi queue and were met by a driver who\ntold us it would be 90 euros for a ride downtown for all four of us with\nour luggage. That was much higher than we expected so we went inside to\nregroup and try to learn about the Rome shuttle service we had read\nabout. We finally gave up and decided to pay the 90 dollars to just get\ngoing. On our way to the line we ran into a driver who told us he would\ntake us for 65 euros. He appeared to be wearing a taxi drivers license\naround his neck, but he took us to the parking lot rather than the taxi\nline. We were really wondering if this guy was legit but he got us\ndowntown in just 35 minutes for the agreed on price.\n\nOur hotel, Albergo Santa Chiara, is right behind the Pantheon. When we\nchecked in, the two managers were looking at us and their list of\ncustomers and speaking angrily as if to say 'what are we going to do\nwith them?' I think it worked in our favor as they gave us one of their\nthree apartments. We have a main room with TV and two pull out beds, a\nmiddle room with another bed, bathroom, and kitchen. However the porter\ntold us \"chicken is locked.\" Finally, we have a master bedroom. So we\nhave a great room for our last three nights of touring.\n\nWe all agreed that we were really really tired of pasta and heavy\nitalian food. Unfortunately we did not have our Rick Steve's book nor\nhad we asked at the front desk about alternative food sources. So we\nsettled for walking to Piazza Navonna to see what they had. We found a\nrestaurant that offered hamburgers and chicken along with traditional\nitalian food.\n\nAs we were sitting at our table waiting for service Kaia noticed a man\ndrawing caricatures in the middle of the piazza. She went to talk to the\nguy who told her he would draw both of them for 20 euros. So, while we\nwaited for our food Josh and Kaia each had a caricature drawn. They are\nboth very good. Josh is a soccer player and Kaia is a runner.\n\nSince we were seated on the outside table right next the the main\ntraffic around the Piazza we were inundated with sales people trying to\nsell us flowers, and all kinds of glowing and buzzing things. In\naddition we had fun watching the people selling scarves and fake Prada\npurses playing cat and mouse with the two police officers patrolling the\npiazza. Everytime they would get their bags arranged on the side walk we\nwould suddenly see a wave of them scooping up bags and heading down the\nsidewalk. Followed by one of the officers. As quickly as the officer\npassed they were back putting their wares down again.\n",

Something I had never heard\nabout before. But had the effect of putting damper on what was otherwise\nan absolutely beautiful day.</p>\n<p>We took off by 8:00 this morning toward Cinque Terre which is an italian\nnational park consisting of 5 small villages along the Mediterranean. To\nget there we drove two hours to La Spezia to take a short 10 minute\ntrain ride to Riomaggiore, the first of the cities. As we got into La\nSpezia it started to rain. We were also down to 1/8 of a tank of gas. As\nwe drove through town I noticed that all the gas stations were closed.\nThis was very curious to me until Jane said rather offhandedly &lsquo;they do\nhave gas strikes in Italy occasionally.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>As usual it was difficult to find parking around the train station, but\nafter driving around for a while we found one relatively close. We got\nour tickets and hopped the first train to Riomaggiore. When we got there\nthe clouds were at about 500 feet and we heard thunder. In Riomaggiore\nyou walk through a short tunnel and then take an elevator to the top of\nthe town. From the top there is a beautiful view of the ocean, mountains\nand vineyards surrounding this little town.</p>\n<p>Our plan for the day was to hike the trails between the first 4 of the\nfive cities and then take the train to the last city to avoid the most\ndifficult part of the hike. Unfortunately it started to POUR as we were\nwalking down main street. So, rather than stand in the middle of the\nroad under our umbrellas we got a covered seat and bought some hot\nchocolate. While sitting at the table we heard a couple of guys from\nVirginia talking. They said they left Rome a day early to avoid the gas\nstrike. When I asked them about the strike they said &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t you\nhear!?&rsquo; &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t buy any gas until tomorrow morning at 7AM.&rsquo; This\ndidn&rsquo;t do my worry gene any good at all so we started looking into\ngetting a hotel room right there in Riomaggiore. No pajamas, no clean\nclothes, no toothbrush or anything. A real adventure. The first two\nplaces we checked were completely booked, but the third place had a\nsmall apartment available. When I inquired about the gas strike she told\nme that stations on the autostrada and some 24 hour stations would be\nopen after 7:00 that night. So after some thought we decided to postpone\nour confirmation of the apartment. We confirmed her information about\nthe gas strike and availability of gas at the national park office.</p>\n<p>So, feeling as relieved as I could in a country where we don&rsquo;t\nunderstand the news we set out on our hike in a very light drizzle. The\nfirst part of the hike, between Riomaggiore and Manarola is a very easy\nand short walk on a well paved trail. The best news was as we were\nhiking along we could see blue sky offshore headed our direction! There\nwas not much to see in Manarola so we continued our hike toward\nCorniglia. This leg of the hike was only slightly more difficult and a\nlittle longer, until we arrived at the Corniglia train station. To get\nfrom the train station to the main part of town you could either walk a\nwinding road or take 500 stairs!</p>\n<p>Having hoped, but missing, the shuttle bus We opted for the road over\nthe stairs. At the top of the stairs we found the pretty town square and\nthe restaurant Cecio! Pesto was invented here in Cinque Terre so of\ncourse there were lots of pesto options on the menu. It was very good!\nJosh and Kaia had pesto spagetti; Jane and I had linguine with pesto. We\nate outside under an awning and had a beautiful view down the valley to\nthe ocean.</p>\n<p>One of the most remarkable things is the walls in this area. There are\nliterally thousands of walls built to make it possible to grow grapes\nand other fruits and vegetables. It would take Shane and his crew a\nhundred years to build all those walls. We also saw some cute little\n&lsquo;roller coaster&rsquo; vehicles, single rail electric powered cars for\ngetting the crops up and down the sides of the hills. We saw oranges and\nlemons and lots of other vegetation.</p>\n<p>After lunch and some wine we headed off toward city number four,\nVernazza. This was definitely the longest and most difficult part of the\nhike for the day. And the sun came out in full force just in time to get\nus all hot and steamy along the way. The hike was even slower and more\ndifficult than usual because of the mud and slippery rocks. However,\nalong the way we had some spectacular views!</p>\n<p>The hike to Vernazza took us an hour and forty five minutes and we were\nall very glad to get to town to find some drinks and gelato. We also\nfound two other fun items for purchase. At a gastronome we bought some\npesto in a jar, along with some special noodles produced in Cinque\nTerre. These noodles resemble communion wafers more than anything else\nso it will be fun to cook them when we get home. Across the street in a\nclothing store I found a pair of Capri pants, so now I can look &lsquo;tres\neuropean.&rsquo;</p>\n<p>Vernazza also has a small beach, so Jane and I sat on the bench while\nthe kids waded in the water. We had fun watching the kids and a golden\nretriever who raced around the beach with the same enthusiasm as Alley\nraces around the backyard. The golden seemed to think its job was to\nkeep the beach free of Pigeons! It was great fun watching him chase from\none side to the other leaping at the Pigeons just as they took off to\nget out of his way. Eventually the Pigeons gave up and found a quieter\nbeach somewhere else. Kaia adopted the dog as her new friend and spent\nsome time petting and talking to him.</p>\n<p>Finally, we decided to catch the 6:28 train to Monterosso al Mare, the\nmost touristy of the five cities. We only spent about 45 minutes in town\nwalking around and looking at the beaches before we caught the 7:24\ntrain back to La Spezia and our 1/4 tank of gas.</p>\n<p>We headed out straight out of town for the Autostrasse hoping that the\ninformation we had received was correct. I was worried that La Spezia\nwould not be a very nice place to spend the night. As we approached the\nentrance area to the highway the sign still showed that there was a\nstrike and no gas was available on the way to Pisa. We kept going,\nhoping that maybe we would find something. The first station we saw did\nindeed look closed but the second station was an Agip and we saw cars by\nthe pumps! We pulled in and saw two attendents standing out by the\npumps. When the first asked if we wanted a fill up I answered &lsquo;YES\nFULL&rsquo; the kids say it is difficult to capture the depth of the emotion\nand relief in my voice when I said that and dubbed that the quote of the\nday.

				"content_html": "<h1 id=\"lunch-in-sienna\">Lunch in Sienna</h1>\n<p>Today we planned to be a light day. We did not get up too early and our\nonly goal was to drive to another hill town called Siena. Jane and I had\nwatched a video about the town so we were excited to see the square in\nperson. The square in Siena is the sight of an annual horse race where\nthey clear out all the restaurant tables and fill the outer ring of the\nsquare with dirt for the race.</p>\n<p>We arrived in time for a late lunch in the square. Rather than picking a\nmore expensive restaurant somewhere in town we opted for sitting along\nthe square and watching the people. It was fun, although the lunch was\nnot all that exciting. Jane and I had Lasagne al Forno and Josh and Kaia\neach had a Salami and Fontina Panini.</p>\n<p>After lunch it started to rain, so we lost our desire to wander around\nthe hill towns of Tuscany.

Jane and I had\nwatched a video about the town so we were excited to see the square in\nperson. The square in Siena is the sight of an annual horse race where\nthey clear out all the restaurant tables and fill the outer ring of the\nsquare with dirt for the race.\n\nWe arrived in time for a late lunch in the square. Rather than picking a\nmore expensive restaurant somewhere in town we opted for sitting along\nthe square and watching the people. It was fun, although the lunch was\nnot all that exciting. Jane and I had Lasagne al Forno and Josh and Kaia\neach had a Salami and Fontina Panini.\n\nAfter lunch it started to rain, so we lost our desire to wander around\nthe hill towns of Tuscany.

Josh is enjoying our drive to Paris by looking at all the cars\nhe would like to drive.\n\nAs I write this in the car, we are all tired and hungry so are very much\nlooking forward to getting to our apartment and having an evening meal.\n\nAfter Jane and I left the kids in the apartment and parked the car we\nall went for a walk to check out the eiffel tower at night. Beautiful.\n\nWe had late night pizza at La Gourmandise. A little Pizza shop that\nseated about 16 people max. Josh and I split a Pizza Margherita avec\nchorizo and Jane and Kaia split the four fromage pizza. Very good.\n",
