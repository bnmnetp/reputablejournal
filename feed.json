Today’s ride turned out to be longer than expected by a good 10 miles. Yesterday started out with a flat tire after only 10 miles. But after the flat the ride was easy and interesting. I crossed the Mississippi “river” several times.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/8788a391e0.jpg\" alt=\"The Mississippi in its not so mighty phase\" /></p>\n\n<p>Today began bright and early with a 6:40AM departure from our campsite at Lake Bemidji State Park.

Today’s ride turned out to be longer than expected by a good 10 miles. Yesterday started out with a flat tire after only 10 miles. But after the flat the ride was easy and interesting. I crossed the Mississippi “river” several times.\n\n![The Mississippi in its not so mighty phase](https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/8788a391e0.jpg)\n\nToday began bright and early with a 6:40AM departure from our campsite at Lake Bemidji State Park.

We’ve been on the road with the camper for 20 days, and it has been quite a trip.</p>\n\n<p>The last few days have been really wonderful. We got to park the camper at Lake Chelan State Park and hang out with our friends Jim and Karen for three days!

We had another pre-dinner wine tasting at the Tsillan (pronounced Chelan) winery. The weather was HOT 95+ degrees. The wine was also really good. I’m bringing home bottles of Rosé and Pinot Grigio. Dinner was in downtown Chelan at Campbells, followed by a campfire back at our site. There were two big RV’s next door to us, each with a gaggle of kids and their bikes. The kids were riding their bikes back and forth, no hands, getting as close as they could to Jim and Karen’s car parked in front of our camper! This was making both Jim and Karen very nervous, and they were ready to make the drive back to their place anyway, so they left.

We were also awaiting the arrival of Jane’s aunt Joanne and uncle Dale. Her cousin David drove them up from Yakima to see us. This is Jane’s last remaining aunt and uncle and we haven’t seen them in years so it was great to see them and have a chance to chat.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/8fda9b38bb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Wednesday, the plan was to head to Leavenworth, where Karen’s parents and cousins live. Karen had a favorite hike for us to do, and Jane’s cousin runs Visconti’s restaurant there. Leavenworth has been remodeled to resemble a Bavarian mountain village and is a charming little town. We enjoyed a lunch at a local Mexican restaurant (Yes, I know, not very Bavarian, but we just had brats for lunch on Tuesday). We visited the local fair trade store that was owned by Karen’s parents as well as the hat shop and toy shop owned by her uncle.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/076aa5d451.jpg\" alt=\"Downtown Leavenworth\" /></p>\n\n<p>Downtown was really hot, so we headed up the mountain to take a hike along the Icicle river.

I had tried to move it earlier in the morning in preparation for our exit but couldn’t move it. Luckily there was a burly young man doing his dishes at the water faucet on the edge of our site who said “I can move that rock for you”. together we rolled it over and we were able to get the camper out. Our next move was to wake up the tenters that owned the parked car and ask them to move it. Thankfully that was not needed.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>The North Cascades (America’s Alps) is a beautiful stop on our journey. Not to mention the warmest temperatures (72 degrees) since Indio! It is also Memorial Day weekend, and the place is a zoo! Cars are everywhere, people are everywhere. Its almost as if friends and families have been freed from a pandemic and are now happily gathering together again after more than a year of quarantine and social distance.</p>\n\n<p>Case in point, our camping neighbors, with double the allowable tents on their campsite, two dogs (Luna and Lance) and countless children. My guess from looking at all of them on the trail is that they are all young tech workers who have made the trek to the National Park to enjoy a holiday together. I really wanted to poll everyone who passed us on the trail “Computer Science degree?”</p>\n\n<p>After arriving and getting the camper situated we decided to hike the Thunder Knob Trail. The info Jane had on the trail said it was 425 feet of elevation gain. The park brochure said 625 feet, but my feet and legs were claiming even more! We had about a quarter of the trek up left to go when a pair of young girls skipped past us and announced “You have a LONG way to go to get to the top!”. Thanks for killing my spirit I muttered. It would not be a proper vacation without at least one hiking turning out to be way more challenging than you thought.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/6d4a2b2c78.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless it was a spectacular view of Diablo Lake. The kind of place you could just sit and contemplate the beauty of nature, and remind yourself that there is a lot of good in our country.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/e4beedf246.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>It was a perfect night for a campfire🔥 unfortunately we were lacking 🪵 🪵 The National Park prohibits gathering 🪵 as well as the sale of 🪵. We should have bought 🪵 in Marblemount from one of the friendly people on the side of the road! We made due with what our predecessors had left us in the fire ring and a little bit of kindling that was laying next to the 🔥 pit. The leftovers consisted of three large 🪵 that refused to really burn. Jane did her best to whittle down the 🪵 into smaller chunks but really only made more kindling. We managed to enjoy it all for a couple of hours anyway.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/412f64e0b7.jpg\" alt=\"Jane making some Firewood\" /></p>\n\n<p>This morning we had many options! Jane had a very long list of hikes we could do. We decided to head for the furthest one called Blue Lake. Alas when we arrived at the trailhead the lot was still under many feet of snow. We hiked through the lot and attempted to find the trail itself, which did not look at all inviting.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/87470615a0.jpg\" alt=\"The Blue Lake Lot is closed\" /></p>\n\n<p>OK, for plan B we drove back toward camp thinking we would stop at Rainy Lake. It looked snowy as well, but the sheet we got from the ranger said that it was “A wheelchair-accessible paved trail to a mountain lake” How hard could it be? Our first clue should have been the couple and their dogs on skis! It turns out that when a wheelchair-accessible trail is under anywhere from 5 to 20 feet of snow it makes for a lot of ups and downs! Lots of slippery climbs and feet sinking six inches into the snow! In short, it was a snowy adventure (in shorts!) just trying to figure out where the trail was.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/73c29e5480.jpg\" alt=\"Works for me...\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/47c93d3ba2.jpg\" alt=\"Is this the trail??\" /></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/71a9b28f29.jpg\" alt=\"This is a good sign!\" /></p>\n\n<p>If Jane hadn’t downloaded the trail on her All-Trails app we would never have found the lake! We would trek a ways forward then stop and consult the map. inevitably we were off to one side or the other of the official trail. We were completely by ourselves, and I immediately thought about the warnings that there were bears and rattlesnakes about. Well, I was not worried about rattlesnakes! I wasn’t really worried about 🐻 either but the thought did cross my mind.</p>\n\n<p>After all of our work to get to the lake it was definitely worth it, all the more so because there were only a few people there. A real contrast to the campground!</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/58df59105e.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p>By the time we finished the hike Jane’s feet were soaked! We were both way more worn out than anyone would ever imagine after a simple two mile hike on a wheelchair-accessible trail 😂 On the way back to the campground we discussed our options. Jane had made a second reservation for tonight at Pearrygin State Park, in case it was too cold in the National Park. Its not cold, but we decided that we might as well make another 60 miles of progress this afternoon as another hike was not in the cards. Who knows how busy this campground will be but we might as well find out.</p>\n\n<p>It turned out great!

This time we stopped and supported the “neighborhood kids” outside of Winthrop by purchasing several bundles of 🪵 for our upcoming 🔥.</p>\n",
				"content_text": "The North Cascades (America’s Alps) is a beautiful stop on our journey. Not to mention the warmest temperatures (72 degrees) since Indio! It is also Memorial Day weekend, and the place is a zoo! Cars are everywhere, people are everywhere. Its almost as if friends and families have been freed from a pandemic and are now happily gathering together again after more than a year of quarantine and social distance.\n\nCase in point, our camping neighbors, with double the allowable tents on their campsite, two dogs (Luna and Lance) and countless children. My guess from looking at all of them on the trail is that they are all young tech workers who have made the trek to the National Park to enjoy a holiday together. I really wanted to poll everyone who passed us on the trail “Computer Science degree?”\n\nAfter arriving and getting the camper situated we decided to hike the Thunder Knob Trail. The info Jane had on the trail said it was 425 feet of elevation gain. The park brochure said 625 feet, but my feet and legs were claiming even more! We had about a quarter of the trek up left to go when a pair of young girls skipped past us and announced “You have a LONG way to go to get to the top!”. Thanks for killing my spirit I muttered. It would not be a proper vacation without at least one hiking turning out to be way more challenging than you thought.\n\n![](https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/6d4a2b2c78.jpg)\n\nNevertheless it was a spectacular view of Diablo Lake. The kind of place you could just sit and contemplate the beauty of nature, and remind yourself that there is a lot of good in our country.\n\n![](https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/e4beedf246.jpg)\n\nIt was a perfect night for a campfire🔥 unfortunately we were lacking 🪵 🪵 The National Park prohibits gathering 🪵 as well as the sale of 🪵. We should have bought 🪵 in Marblemount from one of the friendly people on the side of the road! We made due with what our predecessors had left us in the fire ring and a little bit of kindling that was laying next to the 🔥 pit. The leftovers consisted of three large 🪵 that refused to really burn. Jane did her best to whittle down the 🪵 into smaller chunks but really only made more kindling. We managed to enjoy it all for a couple of hours anyway.\n\n![Jane making some Firewood](https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/412f64e0b7.jpg)\n\nThis morning we had many options! Jane had a very long list of hikes we could do. We decided to head for the furthest one called Blue Lake. Alas when we arrived at the trailhead the lot was still under many feet of snow. We hiked through the lot and attempted to find the trail itself, which did not look at all inviting.\n\n![The Blue Lake Lot is closed](https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/87470615a0.jpg)\n\nOK, for plan B we drove back toward camp thinking we would stop at Rainy Lake. It looked snowy as well, but the sheet we got from the ranger said that it was “A wheelchair-accessible paved trail to a mountain lake” How hard could it be? Our first clue should have been the couple and their dogs on skis! It turns out that when a wheelchair-accessible trail is under anywhere from 5 to 20 feet of snow it makes for a lot of ups and downs! Lots of slippery climbs and feet sinking six inches into the snow! In short, it was a snowy adventure (in shorts!) just trying to figure out where the trail was. \n\n![Works for me...](https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/73c29e5480.jpg)\n\n![Is this the trail??](https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/47c93d3ba2.jpg)\n\n![This is a good sign!](https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/71a9b28f29.jpg)\n\nIf Jane hadn’t downloaded the trail on her All-Trails app we would never have found the lake! We would trek a ways forward then stop and consult the map. inevitably we were off to one side or the other of the official trail. We were completely by ourselves, and I immediately thought about the warnings that there were bears and rattlesnakes about. Well, I was not worried about rattlesnakes! I wasn’t really worried about 🐻 either but the thought did cross my mind.\n\nAfter all of our work to get to the lake it was definitely worth it, all the more so because there were only a few people there. A real contrast to the campground!\n\n![](https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/58df59105e.jpg)\n\nBy the time we finished the hike Jane’s feet were soaked! We were both way more worn out than anyone would ever imagine after a simple two mile hike on a wheelchair-accessible trail 😂 On the way back to the campground we discussed our options. Jane had made a second reservation for tonight at Pearrygin State Park, in case it was too cold in the National Park. Its not cold, but we decided that we might as well make another 60 miles of progress this afternoon as another hike was not in the cards. Who knows how busy this campground will be but we might as well find out.\n\nIt turned out great! We have a great site right next to the lake, and it was a beautiful night to grill some steaks and enjoy a campfire. This time we stopped and supported the “neighborhood kids” outside of Winthrop by purchasing several bundles of 🪵 for our upcoming 🔥.\n\n\n",

When we arrived the man working the booth warned us that due to high winds and the tides today there was a pretty strong chance that our ferry would not run as scheduled. A quick check of the weather app confirmed that the high winds were due to get worse as the day progressed.

When we arrive in Edmonds we will take advantage of our new drive to stop at REI to exchange my defective hiking boots, then hit Costco to refill the tank and finally head to our campground.

Its amazing how smells bring back memories. Sitting outside this walkup restaurant waiting for my burger I was transported back to the drive-in in Storden Minnesota. Yeah, its just hot grease, but still.\n\nOn the way back to the campground there were two more opportunities to see the beauty of the Rogue River.\n\n![Rogue River](https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/03c496ac75.jpg)\n\n![Underground river outlet](https://micro.reputablejournal.com/uploads/2021/3228055414.jpg)\n\nMeanwhile, back at the campground, the plan was to make some soup for supper in the instant pot. But it seems that the electrical cord has gone missing! Another stop at Wal-Mart or best buy I guess.... I don’t know where it could have gone as it has never really left the camper, and I’ve used it at least once before. But we looked everywhere, and by we I mean both Jane and I so it wasn’t just “man looking”\n\nTomorrow we have a fairly long day heading North to Cascade Locks.\n\n\n",
