<p>When I moved this blog to Octopress in January, it was inspiring in many ways.  There were two things that slightly bugged me.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Octopress is entirely too ruby based.  Rake, and all of that made me feel bad, like I was cheating on Python.  Surely there must be a similar tool in the Python world I thought to myself.</li>
<li>Octopress uses markdown.  I really like my restructuredText, and its just a bit irritating to have to think about the differences when I want to do a blog post.</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, this weekend I found a couple of new static blog site generators that <strong>were</strong> python based, and after playing around with Pelican, and <a class="reference external" href="http://getnikola.com">Nikola</a> I settled on the move to Nikola.  I really like the image galleries and slideshows that are built in, and I feel like I can jump in and start hacking if something develops that I really want to change.  Plus, having already hacked a bunch of restructuredText directives, I know I can extend my blogging tool to do all kinds of fun things.</p>
