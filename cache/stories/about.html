<li>Interactive Textbooks:  After writing two editions of two paper textbooks, I said &quot;enough!&quot;  Every time I wanted to write a sentence, all I could think about was how much better it would be if it was interactive.   Thus, in 2011 <a class="reference external" href="http://runestoneinteractive.org">Runestone Interactive</a> was born.  Since 2011 our Python data structures book has been made interactive, and a new CS1 book created.  See the <a class="reference external" href="http://interactivepython.org">Interactive Python</a> site to sample the books.</li>
<li>Rideshare:  The <a class="reference external" href="http://rideshare.luther.edu">Rideshare project</a> at Luther College has provided an ongoing source of web development work for students for five years now.  This open source project is used by Luther and several other colleges.</li>
