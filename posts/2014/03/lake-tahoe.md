## A Rare Day

Lake Tahoe is beautiful.  We arrived last night from Napa and got to our VRBO home, it is great and we had a beautiful view of the lake out our windows.  The sun was just going down and I captured this picture of the Sequoia outside our window.

Today we drove the east side of the lake and met Jim and Karen for lunch, then we went to Emerald bay in the afternoon after Pete and Kim joined us.  Its really hard to describe or write too much about this, so I will just add a few photos here.
