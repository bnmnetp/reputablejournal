A 23 hour train trip?  At some point that seemed like a really charming idea.  Eight hours in, I'll say that the bloom is off the rose.  Its been a nice ride, and a good chance to catch up on some reading and blogging but for the most part its just a long ride on a train full of people.  The views have been OK, but it is now dark outside.
