Brad Miller is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Luther College He is the founder of `Runestone Interactive <http://runestoneinteractive.org>`_. He loves to travel, hack, bike and cook. Not necessarily in that order.


Projects
--------

* Interactive Textbooks:  After writing two editions of two paper textbooks, I said "enough!"  Every time I wanted to write a sentence, all I could think about was how much better it would be if it was interactive.   Thus, in 2011 `Runestone Interactive <http://runestoneinteractive.org>`_ was born.  Since 2011 our Python data structures book has been made interactive, and a new CS1 book created.  See the `Interactive Python <http://interactivepython.org>`_ site to sample the books.


* Rideshare:  The `Rideshare project <http://rideshare.luther.edu>`_ at Luther College has provided an ongoing source of web development work for students for five years now.  This open source project is used by Luther and several other colleges.
