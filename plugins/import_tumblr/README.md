**NOTE** This plugin uses pytumblr, which seems to be python-2 only. Sorry!

This plugin will do a quick and dirty import of your Tumblr site.

To use it:

```
$ nikola install_plugin import_tumblr
$ nikola import_tumblr http://foobar.tumblr.com
```

The output is pretty much unstyled, you will have to add a CSS file to make it pretty. If you can then contribute it,
so I can add it to the plugin, much appreciated ;-)

This plugin will **NOT** import your images, it will just get your data, and all images will stay hosted at Tumblr.
If you are a real user and *want* that, let me know, it's not hard to do.
