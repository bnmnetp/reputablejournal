			 <p>Every Spring we arrive back in the midwest and say that we have to play more golf this summer to keep our games sharp.  In the desert we play several times a week, but in past summers we have maybe only played several times.  This year it will be different.</p>
<p>We got underway in good style today with a round at Keller in St. Paul.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The downside to playing more golf is that I think I&rsquo;m not going to be happy using my really really old clubs that I leave here.  It may require some shopping.  I&rsquo;ve always wanted to go and get fit for a set of clubs, so this may be my chance.  It may also signal that we should bring our clubs with us when we migrate.</p>

			 <p>It has been a lot of years since I have been to a Styx concert, over 40 to be somewhat vague about just how long.  Back then it was the first big arena concert that Jane and I attended together at the Saint Paul Civic Center.  Last night we were at the Agua Cliente casino in Rancho Mirage.  Most of the people were our age so it had probably been a while for them as well.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As I sat there listening to some of the lyrics they really connected with me and our time, probably much more than they did in the early 80&rsquo;s!  From Rockin' the Paradise</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What you doin' tonight?
Well have you heard that the world&rsquo;s gone crazy?
Young Americans, listen when I say
There&rsquo;s people puttin' us down
I know they&rsquo;re sayin' that we&rsquo;ve gone lazy
To tell you the truth, we&rsquo;ve all seen better days</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t need no fast buck lame duck profits for fun
Quick trick plans, take the money and run
We need long-term, slow burn, gettin' it done
And some straight talkin', hard workin' son of a gun</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Come on and take pride, be wise spottin' the fools
Big shots, crackpots bendin' the rules
A fair shot here for me and for you
Knowin' that we can&rsquo;t lose</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If they had written this today I would easily think they are talking about our current administration.</p>
<p>I would also add that these lyrics from &ldquo;The Best of Times&rdquo; kind of express my day to day frustrations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The headlines read, &ldquo;These are the worst of times&rdquo;
I do believe it&rsquo;s true
I feel so helpless like a boat against the tide
I wish the summer winds could bring back paradise
But I know, if the world turned upside down
Baby, I know you&rsquo;d always be around, my my</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have been a member of the ACM since I was in college and encouraged students to become members as a professor.  “Each year we look forward to selecting a new class of ACM Distinguished Members from among our worldwide association of 110,000 colleagues,” explained ACM President Yannis Ioannidis. “ACM’s motto is ‘advancing computing as a science and profession.’</p>
<p>The citation for my membership reads:  &ldquo;For contributions to the development of recommender systems for eCommerce and interactive textbooks for computer science and mathematics.&rdquo;  As a Professor Emeritus of Luther College I&rsquo;m especially proud of this honor, if you look at the other 55 people named this year they are from Google, Microsoft, and lots of prestigious research universities.</p>

			 <p>A hole in one gets a lot of kudos and admittedly I&rsquo;ve never had one.  But today feels even better to me because over the course of four hours I played well, not just one lucky shot.  So yes, I&rsquo;m bragging because I shot my first ever 18 hole round under par.  A score of 71.  Par is 72.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Three birdies, two bogies and the rest pars.  My partner, Yaz, also had an amazing round of 78.  We ended up winning Today&rsquo;s Men&rsquo;s club event, and I won a skin for a birdie on hole 12, a hole that I almost never even par!  It was a tap in after I hit my heaven wood to about 10 inches from the pin.</p>
<p>But maybe even more important than the score was that I played with three other guys who were so nice, and gracious!  It was really a great day all around. Thanks Yaz, Art, and Vic!!  Yaz was a great partner who covered every mistake.  And Art and Vic are just great people.</p>

<p>When I asked Pedro about it, he looked a bit sheepish, thanked me, and said something like, &ldquo;this name is probably better now.&rdquo;  The reactions of people I thought were my friends were just to shrug their shoulders as if &ldquo;too bad for him.&rdquo;  or &ldquo;I guess that is his choice.&rdquo; A couple were  incensed, but not in a way that made me feel like they really understood the underlying issue!   It really took all I had to even stay for games after that.  I slammed my fist on the table and explained why I thought this was so wrong but I got no response, blank stares, as if I was worried about nothing!!!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is not nothing!<!-- raw HTML omitted --> this is appeasement in the 21st century! This is what prime minister Chamberlain did in the prelude to World War II.  We cannot appease Trump, or we will all lose our rights!!</p>
<p>In case you do not get it, the point of my post is this:  We have millions of people in this country who pick our vegetables, serve our food, take care of our yards, and do hundreds of other jobs that &ldquo;regular&rdquo; Americans will <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not<!-- raw HTML omitted --> do.  Yet, we rely on their work.  Let&rsquo;s not demonize them but rather understand them! Appreciate them!</p>
<p>Please write your congressperson or governor or senator and let them know how you feel!!  I <strong>know</strong> the majority of us want justice but we need to make our voices heard!</p>
<p>Please note that I have changed the names, of servers and others to protect them!</p>
<p>Brad</p>

			 <p>Although there is a lot I am worried about in this post-election season, I’m focusing on the good today.  I’m here in the beautiful Coachella Valley for the winter, playing golf in the morning, playing games and having Thanksgiving dinner with friends.  Working it all off with some pickleball in the evening.</p>
<p>We have an amazing daughter and son, who married other amazing people. They are all making the world a better place in their own way.  We have two grandchildren who are precocious, loving, and thoughtful, yet they are only 2 and 4 years old.</p>
<p>I have a wonderful wife who has somehow loved me for more than 66.66% of my life!  I’ve had more than my share of successful careers, and now I get to work on a project that I love, that helps students who need it most,  (<a href="https://runestone.academy">Runestone Academy</a>) and I get to do it on my own schedule, when I’m not too busy doing other things I love (see above).  In short, I have a lot to be thankful for!</p>

			 <p>We awoke in the dark, to the sound of rain dripping outside our door.  Falling back did not result in a lot of extra sleep.  When it was light enough to see outside we saw that it was snowing.  No rush to leave as the long hike we were planning was suddenly not going to be an option.  So we took our time, and enjoyed the scenic drive and lots of scenic overlooks from Capital Reef to Bryce, with a little side trip down the Burr Trail.</p>
<p>Our first little hike was to the singing canyon.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Then we stopped at this amazing overlook about 17 miles down the Burr Trail.  The trail goes for 74 miles before turning into a dirt road, and somehow connecting to a Lake Powell ferry.  The overlook was far enough for us.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here is a view looking back down the trail.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After a delicious lunch at the Burr Trail Burger joint, we drove through Escalante and enjoyed some great views.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We finished up the day with a great late afternoon hike in Bryce Canyon.  It was cold and snowy when we checked in to the lodge. But we decided to head over to the rim anyway to check out the views.  As we got there the sun started to peek out.  We hiked from the Sunset Viewpoint to the Sunrise Viewpoint.  About 3 miles, with a solid climb to get out of course.   It was great to get down in the canyon out of the wind.  The longer we were down there the sunnier it got and the views just got better with every step.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Tomorrow will be a long day in the car, driving from Bryce to Indio.  Maybe through Zion depending on road conditions in the morning.</p>

			 <p>We love to use the drive to California each Fall to visit some of the national parks.  But it is tricky to find a national park to visit this time of year.  Most things are shutting down, and in many parks the scenic drives are closing, and the risk of snow increases every day.  Our original plan had been to visit Great Basin, but park officials closed the scenic drive two weeks ago.  So we rerouted to Capital Reef.  We are glad we did.  The drive in was spectacular, going past Goblin Valley state park.  As you approach from the North, its not hard to imagine you are seeing a goblin sleeping on its back.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What was so great about this time of year is the contrast of the yellow leaves on the Cottonwoods and Aspens, both as you approach the park, and as you drive through.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>There are many interesting hikes in the park.  For our schedule we chose do do the Hickman Bridge, which is about two miles and fairly easy.  The views are great.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Or in some cases spectacular!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We also did a much shorter hike to Sunset Point,  This was fantastic because we were the ONLY people on the trail, so we had the point all to ourselves to enjoy 360 degrees of viewing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Today the plan is to make our way down to Bryce Canyon.  Its cold and raining so we might not see as much as we had hoped, then Monday we will hop on the freeway and make our way to Indio!  Can&rsquo;t wait to reconnect with all our friends, and get back on the golf course and pickleball court.</p>

			 <p>We were just ready to walk out the door to drive to the airport when this happened.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Delta app said our flight was on time, but our incoming plane was late from Detroit. Flight Aware said our incoming plane was four hours late from Minneapolis. Flighty Pro showed our incoming plane as still sitting on the ground in Minneapolis. Sometimes you get a sense that things are going wrong, and this was one of those times.</p>
<p>Delta rebooked us for the same flight one day later. Thanks Delta. I’m sure there were other options to get us back sooner. I know there <em>were</em> seats on an Iceland air flight this afternoon, but those are gone now. Maybe not gone, but the price adjustment systems didn’t take long to make them go from marginally affordable to completely unaffordable for a group of 8!</p>
<p>We cannot get through to Hertz, so we are just going to keep the van. We found a new AirBnB for tonight, and we’ll take advantage of our extra day as best we can. Looks like a trip to the Perlan museum and maybe a short hike, otherwise more hanging around downtown.</p>

			 <h1 id="a-day-in-reykjavik">A Day in Reykjavik</h1>
<p>We left our beautiful seaside house and headed to Reykjavik for a day of city touring.  We were very lucky in that our AirBnB host had our apartment ready for us by 11:30 so we had a base for the day as well as a place for the kids to crash and rest during the afternoon.</p>
<p>Our first stop after dropping our stuff was for an icelandic hotdog at Bæjarins.  Its just a hot dog stand, but they are worth the walk and the wait. There were at least 25 people in line when we arrived.  The line moves quickly.  As there is not a lot to think about.  The hot dogs come with fresh diced onions, some cruncy onions fried in the air frier, Icelandic Remolade, ketchup, and pylsusinnep ( sweet brown mustard). As we were standing in line we struck up a conversation with the lady in front of us who was a tour guide.  I think she was really just charmed by Maren.    She  warned us that we really needed to try the regular hot dog.  When Bill Clinton visited, she told us, he only had mustard, and we&rsquo;ve never forgiven him!</p>
<p>After the hot dogs we all went our own way to explore for the afternoon.   We saw the Viking ship sculpture and the big Lutheran church.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We also checked out Rainbow Road, and lots of shops and a few bars.</p>
<p>Dinner was at  Bastard Brew and Food, just down from our apartment.  Delicious delicious stake sandwiches, in a quirky atmosphere.</p>

			 <p>We arrived at our AirBnB in Grundarfjörður on an amazing evening. We have a beautiful view of the ocean and Kirkjufell mountain right out our window!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/9ea808d3e9.png" alt="" title="Kirkjufell"></p>
<p>After a good nights sleep we spent our saturday in Snaefellsnes peninsula, driving a big loop and taking in lots of sites, stopping for short hikes along the way. The morning began with very sunny weather and the seas outside our window were completely calm.</p>
<p>Our first stop was the town of <strong>Hellissandur</strong>, the street art capital of Iceland. There are so many different buildings with murals painted on the side. This is probably the most famous of them.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/0bdcf41f67.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Not too far down the road from is the <strong>Saxhóll crater.</strong> A small volacano that is easy to climb. Johannes led the way in grand style! The views from the top were great, but it was super windy! One of those winds where you could lean way into it and not fall over.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/a67c9ea301.png" alt="" title="Up the stairs"></p>
<p>After an impromptu comfort stop behind one of the many rocks next to the road we continued on our way to <strong>Djúpalónssandur Beach</strong> We spent a good amount of time here exploring the remains of the Epine GY 7, a British trawler that shipwrecked here in 1948.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/12b117cce8.png" alt="" title="Shipwreck remains"></p>
<p>We also spent a lot of time getting our feet wet in the North Atlantic, throwing rocks into the ocean, sitting on the beach, and saving many starfish that had washed up on the beach.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/16f17ef9d5.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/eb86dbd48d.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It is a great little hike with lots to do. Oh and we all tested our strength by trying to lift a series of rocks, that were part of a test for old sailors. The weight of the rocks ranged from 50 to 340 pounds. You had to be able to lift the 120 pound rock if you wanted to be an oarsman.</p>
<p>After our hike we ate a picnic lunch at one of the picnic tables near the parking lot.</p>
<p>Next up was Arnastapi and statue of Bárdur Snaefellsás, the giant troll man. By this time the youngest ones had had enough touring and were in need of some play time, luckily there was a small playground that was perfect for the situation.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/b00df20ae4.png" alt="" title="The troll"></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/606564128e.png" alt="" title="The big kids at the playground"></p>
<p>Although there was a real need for some nap time, and yes, by this time it was way past nap time. We had one last stop for the day at <strong>Ytri Tunga Beach</strong> The main attraction here was to see some seals.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/15fe540650.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The weather at the beach was really windy, but we did see some seals, so mission accomplished! We had just under an hour to drive back home and it was very quiet in the van.</p>
<p>Dinner this evening was a smorgasbord of what we had leftover for groceries, Icelandic hotdogs, French friends from the fish and chips a few nights ago, and even a few pieces of fish, not to mention the Mac and Cheese that Nana brought with.</p>
<p>Next stop, a short night in Reykjavík and an early morning flight back to Minneapolis.</p>

			 <p>Today was a pretty easy day, we wanted to give the grandkids a bit of a break and let everyone else have an easy morning. So we had our breakfast, and headed off in the van to Gulfoss. These are some serious waterfalls! The Icelanders compare them to Niagara Falls. 1200 cubic meters per second!</p>

<p>The geysir was just a short drive from the falls. The term Geyser originates from the Icelandic Geysir. They don’t tell you that at Yellowstone.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8698.png" alt="" title="Eruption"></p>
<p>We ate our traditional lunch of turkey and pepperoni sandwiches in the parking lot of the geyser center, and then headed back to the house. Maren, Kaia, and Tanner had nap time and Johannes had some quiet screen time. Jane, Josh, and Rachel went back to see more waterfalls, and I got the lamb braising for our evening meal of curry. Considering it wasn’t my kitchen, and I guessed at spice amounts before even leaving home, it turned out great.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we are on the move again to a new house in a new part of Iceland namely Grundarfjor. We will be there two nights before spending our last night in Reykjavik.</p>

			 <p>Today we moved from Vik to our country house on the golden circle. It was a little shorter day with a couple of waterfalls, a trip to the farmers bistro, and a stop at the secret lagoon. We awoke to heavy fog and rain. You have to love dreary weather to live in Iceland! I must say that we have been quite lucky to have a mix of weather including some beautiful sun!</p>
<p>Our first stop of the day was at the Skógafoss waterfall. It is the largest waterfall we have seen so far. There are 500 stairs leading to the top if you want to see the falls from two angles.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8653.png" alt="Top of the falls"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8648.png" alt="Bottom of the falls"></p>
<p>There was another falls, called hidden falls very near Skógafoss which turned out to be a real highlight! We were there early and when we got to the falls nobody else was there. These are also falls where you can walk behind them, kind of magical!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8657.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8667.png" alt=""></p>
<p>One of the few reservations we made on this trip was for our lunch at the farmers bistro. The bistro is part of a mushroom farm, so of course mushrooms feature pretty prominently in the menu. It was a tough call between the mushroom burger and the buffet which featured mushroom soup. But I went with the burger. It was a totally unexpected presentation!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8677.png" alt="" title="Mushroom Burger"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8675.png" alt="" title="Mushroom ice cream"></p>
<p>The buns for the “burger” were two portobello mushrooms, the actual bun was a kind of fried crouton like mixture, and then there was meat which was probably a blend that included lamb. Plus some aioli… The desert menu listed “mushroom ice cream” I just could not turn down the chance to try that! It also listed Carrot ice cream which would have been fine to skip, but it actually tasted a little like sherbet. Still, I really did like the Mushroom with honey topping.</p>
<p>After lunch we waited an hour, (because you have to right!??) and then went swimming at the secret lagoon. Well, it wasn’t very secret, as there were a lot of people there. It is the oldest pool around dating back to the early 1900’s. The water was a very comfortable</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-2264.png" alt="" title="Family pool time!"></p>
<p>The grandkids were <strong>very</strong> tired but we went to a nearby wine bar anyway, after that we got fish and chips takeaway from a nearby restaurant, which was delicious!! The only thing that would have made it better would have been to eat it right there!</p>
<p>By the time we got to our AirBnB, everyone was tired, especially Johannes and Maren who had only been napping between stops. The rest of us were ready to explore the wine bar nearby, and we thought that the fish and chips would be a good takeout option to avoid staying out too late. Even so, we learned that it is probably not a great idea to be out after 6:30 with a 4 and 2 year old!!</p>
<p>That is enough for today!</p>

			 <p>Every country seems to have its own unique kind of natural disasters to worry about. Whether it&rsquo;s hurricanes, sandstorms, typhooons, tornadoes, whatever. In Iceland one of those things is glacial flooding. It happens fairly frequently when water builds up and suddenly explodes out of the glacier. This happened the day before we flew to Iceland, and it closed a section of the ring road. The ring road is a pretty important road around the island, and in fact in many cases the only way to get from point A to point B. For us this closure could have meant two days of our trip needed to be rescheduled. For others who were not so lucky, they needed to drive more than 14 or more hours out of their way to get to the airport or to get to their hotel! Yes, if you haven’t seen a map of Iceland, the middle part of the island has no roads. Our map from Hertz explicitly forbids us from driving anywhere near the middle of the island.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8601.png" alt="" title="Road reopened"></p>
<p>Thankfully the Icelandic people know how to deal with all of this, and quickly got the road opened, at least one lane, as you can see in the picture above. OK, all that sounds very dramatic for something that ended up barely impacting us. Once through the one lane stoppage we had smooth sailing, but along the way we saw many signs of past breaches of the road just like ours. It’s very interesting to note that eruptions and ice melt have actually increased the size of Iceland rather dramatically! The ice melt decreases the mass of the island and causes it to rise up out of the sea! The lava flows and glacial flooding have added more than 5km of distance to the coast in many places! Yep, visiting Iceland is a good geology lesson.</p>
<p>Our first big stop of the day was at Fjaðrárgljúfur Canyon. This was such a beautiful hike up a river gorge, and several of us said it was one of our favorites of the trip so far.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8622.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After the hike we had a nice picnic around the back of our van! Turkey and pepperoni sandwiches, Pringles, weird Icelandic Doritos, and delicious Icelandic butter cookies with chocolate! It’s a hoot traveling with a 4 and 2 year old, as they love picnics! Eat pringles first, chocolate second, set the sandwich down on the gravel… Get upset when the tiniest crumb of Pringle falls on the ground and you are not allowed to eat it. Yes, parents, we have all been there! I’m just so happy to be the grandparent!</p>
<p>With Lunch behind us it was time to move on to the Fjallsarlon Glacier Lagoon, this was not a small commitment as it was another 1.5 hours drive away from our house through lots of flat land. Ocean on one side, sheer cliffs on the other but we were in the flat glacial runoff area. In the end it was a good stop for all! You just know that when you get to water the 4 year old grandson is going to end up with shoes off and pants wet!</p>

So we stopped at the Black Crust pizzeria, the line was really long for getting a table, much less for 8 so we grabbed a to go menu and went back to the house and called. Jane and Josh dropped us off and then headed to the Brewery for some beers! Conveniently, the pizzeria and the gas station share a parking lot, so while one filled up the other picked up the pizzas. We were sitting at our kitchen table eating delicious pizza around seven. We had a black crust Langostine with truffle cream cheese and Rucola, a marinated duck pizza with orange syrup and nuts, and a pretty traditional salami and cheese! Each was the favorite of at least one person!</p>
<p>Everyone had strict instructions that we needed to be out the door by 8 or there would be no time for a coffee stop! So the after dinner activities were largely packing and getting organized to get out the door in the morning. Incentives do work!</p>

			 <p>The weather today was super promising! Small chance of rain, medium chance of sunlight, and big chance for adventure! Our first stop was the home of the Puffins!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/bx9a4535.png" alt="" title="Puffins"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/bx9a4556.png" alt="" title="Puffins"></p>
<p>Boy do they look awkward when they try to fly! From every angle and every view, take off or landing! But they are very colorful and cute!</p>
<p>Our next stop was one of the many black sand beaches. This beach has a warning system, green — explore with caution, yellow — don’t get too close, red — stay in the parking lot. Never turn your back on the ocean and watch closely for rogue waves.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/ant07507.png" alt="" title="The beach"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/ant07503.png" alt="" title="Big Waves"></p>
<p>The plan for the afternoon included the Katla ice cave tour, a lava show, or chilling at the house with the grandkids. The ice cave tour is on the Mýrdalsjökull glacier which is on top of the Katla volcano, currently well overdue for an eruption! No need to worry it is very closely monitored and the guides all have an evacuation plan should an unexpected eruption occur.</p>
<p>It is quite a ride just to get to the glacier, and our guide definitely subscribed to the theory that you can minimize the impact of potholes in the road by driving as fast as possible over them! The glacier itself isn’t like other glaciers as it is covered in ash, and the ice itself has many layers of ice with ash in between the different layers.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/ant07600.png" alt="``"></p>
<p>As part of our hike we also got to help maintain the trail for those coming after us. Just a little work with an ice pick.</p>

<p>After returning to the house I started the spaghetti for supper and Tanner and Johannes headed to the lava show. We also tried it the sauna and hot tub on the deck. This house is so amazing views of the ocean out one window glaciers and horses out the other!</p>

		<a href="https://reputablejournal.com/2024/07/29/family-adventure-to.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-07-29 12:11:34 -0500">Jul 29, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Our Iceland adventure started nearly 10 months ago. We told Kaia, Tanner, Josh, and Rachel that we wanted to bring the whole family on a vacation. Their assignment for Christmas was to make a PowerPoint presentation on where we should go. Then we would discuss the options and vote, if necessary. The presentations were all amazing, and we could see the personalities of each infused into their ideas and presentations!</p>
<p>By the end of lunch, the clear family favorite was Banff Canada! Iceland wasn’t even on the list. So why are we in Iceland? Incomprehensible yield management software at Delta airlines. The price to fly the family from Minneapolis to Calgary was crazy! When Jane started looking around it was clear that Iceland was way cheaper, the best value, and the flight time was not terrible for the two youngest among our group aged 4 and 2. Nobody had presented Iceland, but everyone thought that someone else would. So it was an easy decision.</p>
<p>We arrived in Iceland only a few minutes late, despite our late departure. I don’t know if it was lasting effects of the CrowdStrike problem effecting Delta’s transfer this plane from the hanger to the gate software or what. But neither did the staff at the gate or the pilot for that matter, everyone was mystified by the fact that our plane arrived at MSP many hours early and then sat in the hanger until just minutes before were supposed to depart.</p>
<p>Whatever the ultimate explanation, the flight was fine and we arrived in Iceland at 7:30 AM local time 2:30AM according to our sleep systems. That affected the youngest the worst, but all of us still had some jet lag.</p>
<p>Getting through customs was easy, and although rental cars are always so frustratingly slow, we got some sweet upgrades on our Rental van! A slightly larger van, plus free WiFi hotspot! That is a nearly $600 savings for all of us to have WiFi in transit without paying for a Verizon travel pass. Our first stop between the airport and Reykjavik was at a bakery for some snacks and coffee.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8557.png" alt="" title="Kerid Crater"></p>
<p>This was a great stop for everyone to get the wiggles out after hours on an airplane and then sitting in the van.</p>
<p>Next up was grocery shopping in a foreign country where no one speaks the language! Pretty good, and sometimes amusing, what is “semi-skim milk?” Is this block of stuff called Smjör really butter? Why yes it is if you put your glasses on and read the small translation. Do we want to buy onions and then figure out how to get the self checkout to recognize what we are weighing? No we do not.</p>
<p>Part of our plan for this trip was to buy stuff to make lunch sandwiches in the van while we are out hiking and enjoying the scenery. So we made some lunch!</p>
<p>The next stop was an unscheduled gas station stop when our low pressure light suddenly went off. None of the tires were under pressure so we continued on to our first waterfall. This is a very famous waterfall as Justin Bieber made a music video from behind the water! We were able to go behind the waterfall as well!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8565.png" alt="" title="Waterfalls"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8569.png" alt="" title="Waterfalls"></p>
<p>It was raining like crazy, and we were all wet from the waterfalls so we were very glad to have a text from our AirBnB host that our house was ready ahead of schedule! The house is beautiful and the views of the ocean, mountains, glaciers, and nearby horses are spectacular!</p>
<p>Dinner ended up being at Smidjan Brugghus, the brewery right near our house. The burgers and fries and beer was great. We then worked at keeping everyone awake until just after 8:00 when we gave in and went to bed. Our night was extremely abbreviated when just after nine, our roommate started asking for her mommy! This happened a couple more times before she finally slept through until the morning.</p>

			 <p>Well, it&rsquo;s been a great trip, but it is time to head home. We have a night in Lisbon and then an 11AM flight to Philadelphia tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>This post is a bit of a mishmash of the last day, and some summary thoughts about random stuff.  Maybe more about our Polestar EV than is really necessary LOL.</p>
<p>After driving toward Lisbon for a while we stopped about 45km from the airport to have lunch, which looked like it was in the middle of a field. Well, not a field but a vineyard. We had a really nice Tapas lunch. Calamari, Squid, steak a couple of different ways, and some nice wine in a very nice setting. One of the dishes was called Pica-Pau which I have the recipe for and will definitely try to make this summer!</p>
<p>Drop off at the airport was chaotic, but the metro to our apartment was fine. Although we learned on the ride that we didn’t have hot water in one of the bathrooms or the kitchen. After being ghosted by our first AirBnB host here in Lisbon this was a bit much, but this host did offer us the use of BOTH of her apartments. We don’t need hot water in the kitchen and we can do showers in one bathroom, so we’ll be fine.</p>
<p>We did get out and do a bit of walking around Lisbon, although we are all mostly tired of being tourists so our hearts were not entirely in it. We found a nice rooftop bar that had a view of the city and then a more non-touristy Italian place where the risotto was very good, and the tortellini with bolognese was ok.</p>
<p>Back to our apartment by way of a gelateria, a pastry shop, and a supermarket for a beer to watch the UCL final! On our way home tomorrow! Not happy that Real Madrid won. Boo.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-4326.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As a postscript to this post, I’ll just recall a few of the highlights. I’m writing this from 40,000 feet as we approach the Atlantic coast of the United States.</p>
<ol>
<li>The hiking in Madeira, especially along the Levada at the beginning of the 25 Fontes hike. Also the lunch we had by the sea after that hike was amazing.</li>
<li>Loved our meal in Porto at Taberna dos Mercadores. Delicious and fun.</li>
<li>The wine tasting stop on the Douro was a beautiful spot to enjoy some good wine. The hike down the hill was not everyone’s favorite, but it will be a lasting memory!</li>
<li>Chilling out in the Algarve, and the morning light on the cliffs along the seven hanging valleys hike.</li>
<li>The unexpected lunch stop in the middle of a vineyard on the drive to Lisbon. The steak sandwich and the Pica-Pau were worth the stop!</li>
</ol>
<p>Renting the electric car turned out to be a fun experience. It was a bit nerve wracking a couple of times, but I think that was more to do with being in a foreign country and not having a backup way to pay for the power if the app wasn’t communicating with the pump. It was really nice to have the nav system show you the expected battery level at your next stop. For a long trip, like a drive to California, it would definitely make the drive longer, and require planning! Having a vehicle that was connected to the internet and had charging station locations integrated into the nav system would be great. Our rented Polestar had that feature, but the rental company didn’t have the car set up for internet access. So we ended up using the phone for finding charging, and the car for navigating. A bit frustrating.</p>
<p>I would certainly recommend time in Portugal if you are looking for a vacation option! We did a lot in a relatively short time. You could easily spend a week in Madeira all by itself. We didn’t get to see much of Lisbon, but that was OK for us as I’d rather be away from the city enjoying the green spaces.</p>
<p>Posting this from Minneapolis.  Up way too early this morning.  Going east to west always disrupts my sleep a lot more than west to east.  But at 4am my body was saying that it was 10am in Portugal and that I was being very lazy for sleeping in!</p>

			 <p>This morning we were up early and out the door to do the seven hanging valleys hike. It is about 4.5 miles along the coast in Algarve. Each of the “hanging valleys” is really a cove so we have to navigate around or down and up each of them. Along the way are many chimneys where the limestone has eroded all the way down to a sea cave. We would have seen many of these caves if we had been able to do the sea kayaking the other day. Instead we will see them from above.</p>
<p>Jane drove us to the beginning and did the first mile with us before turning back and driving the car back to the hotel. Brian and I carried on.</p>
<p>Here are a few highlight photos.</p>

			 <p>The plan for our first full day in Carvoeiro (pronounced curve-way-go) was to go sea kayaking through the amazing Benagil sea caves! When we arrived on the corner where we supposed to meet our guide we were a bit early, and nobody else was there yet. Eventually our guide came, long hair, rings on every finger, tanned, very suave. “You are going to have a great day” he said! “I just know as soon as I walk out the door what the sea is going to be like, and today is a very good day.” Another guide heading up the hill asked him, “have you had a look?” We were on the side of the second guide having driven by the landing area. He walked around the corner and returned a few minutes later, with a smile on his face and a new question for us. “Are you ready to get wet?”</p>
<p>Personally, I’m not a huge fan of “getting wet” in the cold Atlantic waters. But I’m willing to be a good sport from time to time. This was one of those times. The next problem was my shoes. Sir, do you have sandals or flip-flops? Nope these are the only pair I brought, well you can walk barefoot down the hill and back then.</p>
<p>So, down the hill we went, and when we got to the landing area the waves were just crashing in, coming in fairly large curls of blackish water! Our guide was undaunted, “If you trust me a little, I can get you out past the breakers and into the calmer water. We probably can’t go into any caves, but it will be fine!” Given his track record so far none of us were inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt, but nevertheless we noted a couple of kayaks going out in between the really bad waves. Suddenly the guides were all huddled around a phone staring intently, I heard the word “suspended.” And finally the guide admitted defeat. The maritime authorities have declared that all kayaking trips are cancelled this morning. I could still get you there, but you would all be breaking the law. LOL.</p>
<p>So our day of kayaking was a bust. Even worse, none of us took a picture of the waves!!</p>
<p>With kayaking out of the picture we headed to Carvoeiro to do the boardwalk. It was very scenic and considerably drier than the kayaks.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8331.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8326.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After doing the boardwalk we came back and made ourselves sandwiches, and hung out at the pool, reading, dozing, and whatnot.</p>
<p>For dinner we headed back in to Carvoeiro for dinner at an Indian restaurant called Gurkha Kitchen. It’s a Nepalese and Indian place that was very good. We / I was definitely in the mood for something a bit different than we had been eating for the last week, and this fit the bill perfectly. Papadams, some dumplings, some Nepal curry, it was great. We could have gone higher on the spice levels but we all enjoyed the food very much.</p>
<p>This morning we woke up, took our time with coffee etc, and then headed for Sagras, it is the farthest southwest point Europe. You know this because there is a bratwurst stand that says Last Brat before America!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8348.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Unfortunately when we arrived a massive cloud bank was rolling in, and we couldn’t see anything! Also the fort was not open because the workers were on a one day strike! So it was kind of a bust. Here you see our selfie at Sagras and then another selfie just 30 miles away less then an hour later!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8352.png" alt="" title="Sagras"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8372.png" alt="" title="Lagos"></p>
<p>The second picture was taken in Lagos on Ponte do Piedade, it was so beautiful that after taking pics from above, we ended up driving into town, finding a charge point, eating lunch, and then booking a boat to take us out to see it from the water!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8366.png" alt="Memories of the Gold Coast"></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8413.png" alt=""></p>
<p>By the time we finished the boat trip and walked back to the car it was nearly 5:00, so we still had a very full day despite the challenges of the morning. We headed back to the hotel, showered, rested for a bit then had a light dinner at a nearby pizza place called Mona Lisa. It was kind of funny because it was just right around the corner, but then Jane discovered that they only took cash. We were nearly out, so it was kind of like college. Well, we have some euros, you have some euros, and if we turn in our towels at the front desk we can get our 40 euro deposit back and have enough money to eat! It sure beat jumping in the car and driving a mile to find an ATM!</p>
<p>After dinner Jane and I went to the end of the lane to enjoy a bit of sunset!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8427.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8425.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Just as we were about to go to bed we got the news alert. The jury was in! Would they convict Trump? We waited as the pundits did their punditry and then finally the verdicts were read. One by one, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty on all counts! A small celebration broke out and a chant of “Lock him up!” Of course, soon enough the convicted felon emerged to tell us that “it was rigged” LOL!! This is a good day for America, the system worked and finally we are holding Trump accountable. In any other decade in our history, for any other political party, the nominee would bow out of the race, or the party would demand the presumptive nominee give way. Sadly that will not be the case here.</p>
<p>Tomorrow some hiking and then just relaxing before head into Lisbon on Saturday. It’s hard to believe that we are heading back in just a couple of days.</p>

			 <p>After our busy day in the Douro Valley it was time to head south! Our first stop of the day was the Europcar desk to pick up our electric ID3. But wait… we were upgraded to a Polestar 2! We had looked at all of the charging stations and decided this would be a great chance to try an electric vehicle! All was well until we arrived in Nazare - If you haven’t watched 100 foot wave you really need to watch a couple episodes! In Nazare it was time to recharge. Using the MIIO app, it was no problem finding a station, but getting the car to charge was like a clown show! Rookies! Two young American college students were trying to do the same thing, and it was pretty funny that we could not quite get it. We had all foolishly assumed that we could swipe our credit card and charge away! (Pun intended.) Instead we had to create an account on the app and preload it with some $.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8265.png" alt="" title="Charging the car!"></p>
<p>With the car finally charging, we headed out for lunch and some sightseeing! We found a great burger stand, which was just what we needed after a week of enjoying mostly native Portuguese food. From there we walked to the lighthouse and enjoyed the views of the beach. There are no 100 foot waves this time of year, but it was fun to see the sights from the show in person.</p>
<p>From Nazare we went to Obidos, this is a cool old walled town, supposedly the birthplace of Ginja. For me it also brings back memories of the early days of the internet and working with Amazon where the URL always contained obidos. Obidos was their original page rendering engine, named after a town in Brazil which is the swiftest part of the Amazon river. The town in Brazil was named after Obidos in Portugal. We walked the walls and enjoyed the sights from this little hill town.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8271.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8268.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8269.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After Obidos we headed to Ericeira for a two night stay on the ocean. We had a two bedroom apartment booked, which was upgraded to a four bedroom. Even better was that the parking ramp for the hotel had parking with free charging for electric vehicles! The hotel was lovely and we were too tired to do much more for dinner than eat at the restaurant in the hotel. The food was good.</p>
<p>The plan for the next day was a day trip to the hilltop castle in Sintra, the Peña Palace. As we get older we get smarter, so rather than hike up the hill we used the Bolt app (Uber competitor) to get a ride to the top! Eight euros later and we were there! We walked down, but more about that later. The Peña palace is a huge sprawling complex with miles of hiking paths, castle walls, and a tour of the inside of the castle (which we skipped). There are other palaces and castles very close by including the Moorish castle. We enjoyed the hiking and sites of the castles.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8279.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8295.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8297.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then it was time to see what we missed on the hike up! Boy are we glad we took the bolt instead of walking! As we were headed down a particularly steep section we met a couple coming up, breathing heavy and sweating. He asked “how much further?” I responded, “where are you going?” Expecting either Peña Palace or Moorish castle, the reply instead was, “to the nearest Uber!!” I laugh every time I think about that!</p>
<p>Holly had several options picked out for lunch and we ended up with a really nice one. Then back to Ericeira and some restful time by the pool.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we head off to Algarve for the relaxing part of the vacation!</p>

			 <p>The train ride started peacefully enough. However when the conductor came to check our tickets the guy across the aisle was unresponsive. Like does he have a pulse? Unresponsive! A couple of stops later the EMTs got on the train and managed to get him awake. Soon after he was off the train. As usual the paperwork took longer than anything and we were soon 20 minutes behind.</p>
<p>We had thought that the train ride would be fun, with four seats facing each other, maybe a table to play Euchre or Qwertle. But the train was a “historic” train. No tables, no electricity to recharge devices. But the scenery was very nice. We got off the train in Pinhão to visit the Quinto Do Jollata winery, high above the city. We needed to either Uber or take a taxi. The Uber was advertising the ride for 5 euros, but no drivers were taking us up. There was a taxi with a feisty Portuguese woman driver. She told us 15 euros. When we said we were told that it would be 5 she slammed the car door shut in a huff. Then probably swore at us. We agreed to her 15 and got in for the ride. By the time we arrived we all thought that 15 was probably appropriate! The views from the winery were spectacular!</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8238.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The tasting area was also beautiful.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-1077.png" alt="" title="Douro Valley Tastes!"></p>
<p>There was a trail from the winery down to the city, and we had decided ahead of time to walk down. The host at the winery said to follow the dirt road to the end of their property then to climb over the fence to their neighbors, and continue to walk toward the bridge. By the time we got to the fence, one of us had had it! LOL.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8244.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once back in the city we boarded a boat for a ride to Tua. More beauty but this time from the river!</p>
<p>In Tua we had a bit of an adventure finding the train station. We didn’t have a lot of time, and in our haste ended up away from the station, but deciding that the most expedient way forward was to simply walk the tracks, listening carefully for an approaching train!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8249.png" alt="" title="Walking the tracks with Jane"></p>
<p>We arrived safely! As it turned out the train to Porto was at the station but the train to Pocinho was not there yet. We looked for a conductor to see if we could just hop on and go back to Porto, and I finally found one, but just as I was asking him the question the train to Pocinho pulled in and he said if we wanted to go to Porto we had to get on right now. We dithered for a second to long and thus were committed to riding to the end of the line. In the end we all agreed we should have jumped on the train back when we had the chance.</p>
<p>The ride back to Porto was fine, but long, and at times VERY crowded. Speaking of crowded that is the only way to describe Time Out! Finding a place to sit took a couple of trips up and back, but we did eventually find a place for the four of us to sit. Jane and Holly saved our spots while Brian and I braved the ravenous hoards to gather our dinner. Jane had the duck rice which was kind of like a layer of rice with duck over the top covered in a thick layer of cheese. It was delicious. I had the Sea bass over Quinoa with Crayfish sauce. Also wonderful, but it turned out to be a starter! I wish I had ordered two!</p>
<p>To say we were exhausted after 12 hours on the train, and hiking and wine tasting is an understatement. Tomorrow is an easier day with just a bit of walking around town, and maybe visiting a port house.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We started today with a short walk to meet our guide, Maria, for a food tour of Porto. Maria is a private chef and sommelier who does these tours as well. She grew up in the neighborhood of Porto that we were visiting. We made several stops during our tour so let&rsquo;s review, step by step.</p>
<ol>
<li>Nota and coffee and Hungarian cookies. We had been waiting to try the Nota since we landed in Lisbon. But we did not want to have our first taste be something mass produced for airport visitors. This did not disappoint. The Nota is a pastry filled with egg custard. Seriously, the egg custard reminded me of my mom’s whipped cream where you could feel the sugar crunch between your teeth as you ate it. We also had a shortbread cookie that was half dipped in chocolate called a Hungarian. Both were great. Lots of pastries are made with egg yolks because the nuns who originally made the pastries used the egg whites as starch to stiffen their habits. <img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-0987.png" alt=""></li>
<li><strong>Spice store</strong> Romeo and Juliet (cheese and apple jam) At the spice store where Maria has shopped since childhood we tried the Romeo and Juliet, a slice of cheese topped with a dense slice of Quince on top. The salty cheese and the sweet marmalade were a perfect combination.</li>
<li><strong>Market</strong> From the spice store we headed to the main market. It is a beautiful open air market, newly remodeled I think. Apparently once you have the license for a stall you can pass it on to your direct descendants, otherwise it is very hard to get in.
<ol>
<li>Figs with Walnuts: we started with a taste of a fig stuffed with a walnut. Pretty tasty even for me who is not a big fan of figs.</li>
<li>Beans (lupins) and Olives: The olives were olives, enough said. (I’m not a fan) But the Lupins were really interesting. You peel off a thin shell and then eat them. The consistency and taste reminded me of a rather hard cheese, and Maria confirmed that the lupins are often used to make a vegan cheese.</li>
<li>Oyster and Mussels: Fresh oysters and Mussels. Pretty good. Brian did the oyster on the half-shell, the rest of us mussels. Not sure I’ve had a raw mussel before, it seemed like it had been cooked and then served cold.</li>
<li>Sardines and Cod on crackers: Ok, this one tested us a bit. Sardines were a real staple of the Porto diet, especially if you were a working class family. I really wasn’t even sure I wanted to try one, but when you are on a food tour you just do it, that’s what you are there for. I thought the sardine on a cracker was quite good. The cod was more fishy to my taste but still decent. We actually went back and bought a tin of sardines to take on the train to the Douro valley. The cod in Porto is all dried, and then reconstituted when it is time to eat it, can you say Luetefisk? <img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-1002.png" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-1001.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Ginja: Time for a drink! Ginja is a cherry liquor served in a chocolate cup. I’m not a huge cherry fan, but this tasted a little more like anise, or if you are in a bad mood you might say cough syrup.</li>
<li>Iberian and Black pork: Although I had tried the black pork, this was our chance to see the Iberian and black pork side by side. When we tried several slices of the different pork side by side it was easy to see why the black pork is so much more expensive. 60 euros per kg for the Iberian, and 180 euros per kg for the black. In fact Maria said that when you are getting the black pork it is important to have the butcher cut it in front of you so that you can verify that it is the black pork. When we got some to bring on the train we did just that. We also learned how they use every part of the pig, and how in the battle against Spain the residents of Porto were used as human shields to protect the city which never fell! (Porto Invictus) The humans used as shields were treated to the best parts of the pig whereas the people being protected made due with the worst. <img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-1007.png" alt=""> <img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-1008.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Bread: We tried the peasant bread made with malt, barley and wheat flour. It was a very dark bread, and tasted like it had molasses in it, but that is just the malt. It lasts for a couple of weeks, and then you use it in bread pudding.</li>
<li>Bonus Ginja: as we were leaving the market another tour guide came up to us with a tray of Ginja — We didn’t use it all with our group, please enjoy another glass! <img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-1004.png" alt=""></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Fancy Paste store: This was kind of an odd part of the tour. Whereas everything so far had been about the peasants and working class people and their food, this was a high end store featuring tubes of paste made from every region of Portugal. We tried some savory, some sweet, and some chocolate. We felt a little pressure to purchase, and so we did get three tubes to bring on the train.</li>
<li>Hot dogs and drinks: Our last stop was at a local establishment that makes the best hot dogs anywhere. This place is famous because Anthony Bourdain loved the place and featured it on his show. Reportedly he and the owners also became good friends over the years and he visited every time he was in Europe. There was a line to get in, but the hot dogs (and buns!) were really good. <img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-1013.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Time Out market: As a bonus, Maria walked us through the Time Out Market, right next to the train station. This is kind of a high end food court where a few different Michelin starred chefs make their food available. It looks like the perfect place to grab a bit to eat when we get off the train from the Douro valley.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the food tour we rested for a few minutes and then headed out across the bridge to Gaia. Along the river in Gaia is where all of the port houses are. The wine is transferred from the Douro Valley into town where it is aged and transformed into port. We planned on tasting in the Douro, but still enjoyed some time at the rooftop bar of one of the places. By the time we were done there we took the cable car back up to the bridge and walked back to our apartment. We were exhausted, so Brian and I walked to Rocky’s for some kebabs and pizza for supper.</p>

			 <p>As much as I was dreading the flight on Ryan Air, it was a very smooth and uneventful flight. We had upgraded to premium tickets so we had assigned seats, as well as “priority boarding”. That just meant that if you were at the gate early enough you got into the queue to get on the plane ahead of the non-priority passengers. If you didn’t, then you were stuck in the queue wherever it was when you showed up. Luckily we heeded the alert to head to the gate a little more than an hour before takeoff.</p>
<p>I was seated next to a very cute two year old, whose parents were mortified every time he made a sound. I just kept smiling and telling them it was fine. He was fascinated with my iPad, but declined to help me with the NYT crossword. We arrived in Porto and our next destination was the Metro. We were not sure how to find it…</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-0920.png" alt="" title="Finding the Metro"></p>
<p>It was a very easy trip on the metro with one transfer to get within a couple blocks of our AirBnB here in Porto. It’s a lovely 3 level apartment overlooking a little alley off another alley. There is a restaurant right below us. After dropping our luggage we were all a little “hangry” so we found a restaurant just up the hill, we had a reservation for 9PM so we just wanted a drink and a few tapas. The restaurant also had the sandwich called a Francesinha. It’s a slice of bread topped with steak, topped with more bread and then ham and sausage, topped with bread and cheese and tomato sauce. It’s Portuguese hangover food. (For the record we were not hungover) For us it was like having a grilled ham and cheese sandwich with tomato soup poured over the top!! Talk about childhood memories.</p>
<p>We explored the waterfront area for about five hours before our next meal! Which meant walking around and stopping at a few different wine bars… Yes, periods of starvation followed by periods of foodie excess! Dinner was at a tiny (16 person) restaurant called Taberna dos Mercadores. This was a recommendation from my stepbrother Dwight and his wife Laurance. We made the reservation a month and a half ago, which was a good thing because there was a huge line of people with no reservations hoping to get in. We ended up seated next to two young women from New Jersey (They were in Portugal to see Taylor Swift) who tried to get in last night, but worked their way to the front of the line, only to be turned away! But they came back earlier and were rewarded with a table tonight. They knew exactly what they wanted to order the moment they sat down.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8220.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We were happy to have a more leisurely pace! The service was great, our waiter had a fun sense of humor, and the food was excellent. Holly had the flaming sea bass.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-0972.png" alt="" title="Flaming sea bass"></p>
<p>I had Veal and a HUGE pot of Risotto! Large enough for the whole table to share. Brian had Cod and Jane had Ribs. Soooo much good food. By the time we were done it was well after 10:00 so we made our way home and fell into bed!</p>
<p>What a great first day in Porto! And yes, for the record, we might need another Francesinha in the morning. Although we have a food tour starting at 11. Stay tuned.</p>

			 <p>We woke around 7 again this morning. One possibility was to do the difficult hike from Areeiro to Ruivo, the so called “peak to peak” hike. A hike that can take 6 hours, with a LOT of elevation change. We decided to just go to one peak and enjoy the view, then do an easier hike somewhere else. This was probably a good decision as when we arrived at the pico it was very “cloudo” and we could not see much. But I’m getting ahead of myself!</p>
<p>We left the condo, and got in the car to head out… We missed a turn, and ended up on a different route that was basically 6 miles of city driving straight UP HILL. I’m so glad Jane was driving as I would have totally ruined the clutch on our rental car before escaping the city! Stopping and starting behind city busses on what must have been nearly 45% grade. I’m not exaggerating, I looked it up and that grade does exist in Funchal! Many are 25% or more.</p>
<p>Once out of the city the roads were less steep and really quite beautiful. Driving through some really old trees with the sun filtering through, it looked like we were going to be very lucky and get a great view. We happened upon a pack of mountain bikers! What a climb for them.</p>
<p>Sadly when we arrived at the parking area the clouds were starting to roll in.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8149.png" alt="" title="Pico Areeiro"></p>
<p>At one point we could not even see the top anymore. Much less any of the scenery below us! Nevertheless we climbed to the highest point for a quick picture.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-3830.png" alt="" title="On top of Areeiro"></p>
<h2 id="the-footpath-of-ponte-de-são-lourenço">The footpath of Ponte de São Lourenço</h2>
<p>After Areeiro we headed to the far north eastern end of the island to get some completely different scenery. This was a highly rated hike that lets you see the ocean from both sides of the path as you walk along ridge lines and up and down. The popularity of this was confirmed as we started to see cars parked precariously along the edge of the road at least a mile from the trail head. We made a couple of attempts to get lucky at finding a closer parking spot and were rewarded with a safe and relatively close spot our second lap!</p>
<p>It was fairly far to do the whole out and back hike so I set this saddle point as my goal, although I will say that there was not a consensus among the group as to how realistic that goal was.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8184.png" alt="" title="The saddle was my goal"></p>
<p>The trail was super busy but the sights were amazing. I really loved all of the colors in the layers of the rocks!</p>

<p>After a wonderful hike we headed back to our apartment. We decided to stop for lunch after parking the car, realizing that if we returned to the apartment inertia would set in, and we would likely just sit there and starve. So we stopped at the Coachella restaurant. One of those along the hillside where there was always a woman trying to entice us to stop in and try the food. It had good reviews anyway so we risked it. It was well worth the stop even though we were all tired and sweaty from the hiking.</p>
<p>We still wanted to go back to one of the places back in old town in one of the long alleyways full of restaurants. We walked up and down the alley, accosted at every turn by eager restauranteurs who wanted to convince us to dine at their establishments. It was awful. We finally selected one, and although the food was good, the service was indifferent at best and hostile at worst. I had a steak with pepper sauce and fries. Yes the fries were what I really needed. :-)</p>
<p>After dinner we walked through the entertainment district, listened to some outdoor music and enjoyed a lovely after dinner drink at The Ritz. Tomorrow is a leisurely morning then off to the airport for our flight to Porto!</p>

			 <p>This is our first full day on Madeira after flying Minneapolis to Toronto to Lisbon to Funchal, overnight, etc. etc. We powered through a half day of walking around town eating pizza and trying some local drinks. We had to go see the statue of Cristiano Ronaldo to see if it was as bad as it was in the pictures!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8101.png" alt="" title="CR7"></p>
<p>It was… Next ask yourself the question, why is his crotch extra shiny?? There is so much to do in Funchal, that I can already see we could have spent a week here easily. We did try the Madeira wine as we were walking around. Just eating our way through all the local places could take more than a week.</p>
<p>We all made it past 9pm! Today we woke up around 7am local time. 1AM CDT. We had an extremely aggressive hiking plan for today and immediately realized we had to tone it down. So we opted for the Levada das 25 Fontes. A levada is an irrigation channel or aqueduct specific to the Portuguese Atlantic region of Madeira. Basically they are small channels designed to bring the rain water from the upper elevations to the region around Funchal and other areas that need the water. We saw the water flowing through channels along the roads as we climbed our way toward the start of the hike.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8108.png" alt="" title="Levada"></p>
<p>The first part of the hike was great, it was right along the Levada with great scenery lovely trees and greenery. Quite an engineering project if you ask me!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8115.png" alt="" title="Downhill Levada"></p>
<p>After about 4 miles of hiking we found ourselves at the actual 25 Fontes part of the hike! The usual way to the start of the hike was just a boring walk downhill on a very narrow road. So this way was much better and more interesting. But by then we were pretty tired from the long rough descent, so we only did a small part of the original hike.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8133.png" alt="" title="Waterfalls"></p>
<p>By the time we finished it was 2:00 in the afternoon and we hadn’t really eaten anything other than a few snacks. So we picked a lovely restaurant down by the sea to stop for a delicious lunch!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8146.png" alt="" title="Lunch at Engenho Velho"></p>
<p>The view was amazing and the food was great also! Brian had Scabbard fish, Jane had baked Octopus, I had Portuguese black pork and Holly had Tuna steak. All deliciously prepared over an open fire. We all shared and all the dishes were really good.</p>
<p>By the time we got back to our AirBNB we were ready for showers and then happy hour. At happy hour we tried the Poncha and some Portuguese green wine, and a cheese plate. We played a game of Qwirkle at another local establishment and called it a night at 10pm! Tomorrow is another HUGE day of hiking.</p>

			 <p>It is time for the annual migration back to Minnesota. Close up the house in the desert for the summer, and get in the car for a few days. This spring our itinerary is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Indio to Phoenix and meet friends for dinner.</li>
<li>Phoenix to Santa Fe with a stop at the Petrified Forest</li>
<li>Santa Fe to Kansas City (borrrrriiiiinnnggg)</li>
<li>Kansas City to Decorah IA.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once in Decorah, I’ll be in board of regents meetings for a couple of days. The meetings this week are highly consequential with the announcement of the impending retirement of our president, Jenifer Ward, we have some real thinking to do about how to set the course for the next several years.</p>
<p>Most of the drive is pretty flat, following the high plains! Not many trees, the desert turns to fields for as far as you can see. But the stop at the Petrified Forest was interesting. The science behind the petrification of the trees, and the views of the mesas and the painted desert were really great.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8086.png" alt="" title="The Blue Mesa"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2024/img-8073.png" alt="" title="Petrified Wood"></p>
<p>We arrived in Santa Fe a bit later than planned due to a lot of road construction! But we walked around for a bit, then tried a couple Margaritas at the highly rated bar in the La Fonda hotel. We had a later reservation at Sazon, a James Beard winner in Santa Fe. Dinner started with a sampler platter of Moles and another Margarita. (I am now a huge fan of Mezcal over Tequila) After we had a chance to try the various Moles, our water presented the menu. Lots of different options to go with the various Moles, so it all made sense! Jane ordered the Cholula — a tower of chile poblano / ground lamb, pork and beef / nuts / dried fruits, spices over a cold creamy walnut sauce / pomegranate seeds / balsamic jalapeño reduction! Jane describes it as having the main course and desert at the same time. It was really delicious. I opted for the pork loin with one of the spicier moles on the menu, served with rice it was truly a feast! We even got a chance to chat with the chef, Fernando Olga, who dropped by our table in jeans, chefs coat and cowboy hat.</p>
<p>It was a great evening, but tomorrow is nearly a 12 hour drive to get to Kansas City.</p>

			 <p>Our last zodiac adventure! 😭 But our first chance to put foot on the continent proper. Not an island off the content but the actual Antarctic continent!! 🐧The beautiful sunny weather of the morning had turned misty and cloudy by mid afternoon.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/img-0067.png" alt="" title="On the Continent"></p>
<p>Lots of views of Gentoo penguins, and one lost Chinstrap!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/img-0135.png" alt="" title="Maybe they won’t notice my chinstrap"></p>
<p>The Gentoos were coming down to the water to take a swim/much needed bath, and then got spooked by our zodiac. As we were sitting offshore we saw four of them swimming toward us. They were underwater but we could see them very clearly. Suddenly they swooped right under us and flew out of the water onto the shore. Nobody had a camera or video going or it would have been the most spectacular shot of the trip.</p>
<p>As we drifted away, I did get a couple great sequences of them diving off the rocks into the water.</p>

			 <p>This expedition is just so amazing. Every time you think you have seen “the best” then another day comes along with another bay, or a change in the weather to a beautiful blue sky and you are just standing there once again wondering how can it get any better than this?</p>
<p>We started the day with a landing on Damoy point, home to thousands of Gentoo penguins as well as British and Argentine emergency huts. The British hut was open so we were able to walk inside and have a look.</p>
<p>The penguins were cute as usual, although a bit more pungent than usual if you ask me. The bay was just incredible with mountains on either side soaring skyward. At one point we were hiking and Jane and I both stopped because we heard “thunder” it was an avalanche in the distance somewhere. We didn’t see it, and according to Ignacio by the time we hear it the slide is already over anyway.</p>

<p>The really incredible part of the morning came after we were back on board and sailing through a big s-shaped area, the sun was out, the sea was dead calm and the reflections were beautiful.</p>

<p>So many reflection pictures, and it was just incredible to stand there in awe of it all. Then along came some penguins swimming and diving in the water. It was amazing we could see them under the water as well as when they came flying out of it. Look closely at this picture there are three penguins!</p>

			 <h2 id="polar-plunge-day">Polar Plunge Day</h2>
<p>Today we officially crossed the Antarctic Circle. It’s a unique club to belong to. We were supposed to have a zodiac cruise or a landing, but the bay we were heading to (all the possible bays actually) were so full of brash ice and growlers that we had to slow our speed to only 3 knots. Also it was snowing like mad. So, it was determined that today we would not do that, today would be the day for the Polar plunge. Even more special since we were south of the Polar Circle.</p>
<p>Jane and Ann enjoyed it thoroughly, Jerry and I enjoyed watching our crazy wives. The plunging festivities started around 10AM.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/img-7953.png" alt="" title="Getting ready to plunge with Suzy"></p>
<p>The plunge itself is pretty simple. Strap into a harness, walk to the end of the “plank” count down from three and jump. Get back out of the 32 degree water as quickly as possible!</p>
<p>Enjoy a shot of your favorite adult beverage to celebrate!</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/img-7959.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The rest of the day was spent cruising back to the North, so our time in the circle was fairly short. But it was nice to have a calm day to enjoy some reading and games and relaxing. Tomorrow we should have our final two excursions before we head back across the Drake to Ushuaia.</p>

			 <p>Antarctica is a continent. It is not “owned” by any nation, but is governed by an international treaty. Countries may maintain research bases in Antarctica but no country can claim a part of the continent as their own territory.</p>
<p>Today we got to cruise by a Ukrainian station. Under other circumstances we would have been allowed to visit the station, but unfortunately they were in the middle of a resupply process and could not accommodate visitors.</p>

<p>So, we cruised around and saw a little colony of Gentoo penguins. Visited an “iceberg graveyard” and saw some seals!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/ant07167.png" alt="" title="Gentoo Penguins"></p>
<p>But the new animal for today was the Weddell Seal. Just lounging around on the ice pack.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/ant07193.png" alt="" title="Moving around"></p>
<p>The highlight of the afternoon will be cruising across the Antarctic circle. We were just commenting at lunch today that it was amazing how much we have seen but we have only seen a tiny tiny fraction of the continent. Everything we have seen and will see is part of the Antarctic peninsula that extends farther North.</p>
<p>Right now I’m watching a lecture on the Cetacians of the Antarctic. We have seen a lot of humpback whales, but there are also Minke whales, Fin whales, Right whales, and even Sperm Whales. Note that Sperm Whales are toothed whales not Baleen. Orcas are also quite common, including the ice pack Orca. This is a group of Orcas that engage in pack hunting. They will actually find a seal on the ice and attack the pack ice from below breaking up the ice and leaving the poor seal floating on a tiny bit of ice. From there they will push the seal off the ice and enjoy their lunch.</p>

			 <p>An easy afternoon to see some Adélie Penguins. So this is the third species of penguin that we have seen: starting with Chinstrap, then Gentoo (yes like the Linux distro) and now the Adélie. The Adélie is the only true Antarctic penguin.</p>
<p>The hike was easy and flat, and we were the first group this season to visit this large colony. We know that because our guides looked for a staircase from a previous ship and could not find one, so they had to dig one for us.</p>
<p>Our first bit of penguin drama came when the Skuas arrived. These are birds that are predators on the penguin eggs. They are very brazen predators as well, landing right next to the penguins laying on the nest! You can see it here with the one penguin looking quite alarmed, and the other just meekly pointing at the Skua as if to say “help?”</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/ant07106.png" alt="" title="Help"></p>
<p>This guy however was definitely putting up a braver front! I got more of a “None shall pass” vibe.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/ant07110.png" alt="" title="None shall pass"></p>
<p>But, the Skuas can’t be everywhere so there were plenty of additional Adélie to observe and enjoy their expressions. These three really got me.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/ant07090.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Of course all is not just work in penguin land. I can’t imagine two penguins having more fun than these two little guys!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/ant07151.png" alt="" title="Penguin snow swimming"></p>
<p>Finally, just a purely lucky shot. Our guide Ignacio has been talking about different techniques for composing shots and has talked about “frame in a frame.” I saw this from the zodiac heading back and thought it was a nice frame in a frame. It wasn’t until I got the photo onto my iPad and did a little cropping that I saw the Adélie in the middle of the frame!</p>

			 <p>What started as an ordinary excursion turned extraordinary when we found ourselves surrounded by humpback whales!</p>
<p>We were just cruising through some brash ice and looking at some birds when we heard the radio call from Jonathan. “I am nine o’clock from the ship and have four humpbacks.” We quickly made our way toward his position, gliding in very quietly the last 100 meters.</p>
<p>Then we heard and saw them a short distance away. Breath going out the blowhole, whoosh. Sometimes they would just glide along the surface like a giant surfboard, sometimes they would arch their backs and slowly sink back under the water, sometimes they would dive and show their tails as they disappeared under the water.</p>
<p>At one point two of them headed straight at our zodiac. One went directly under the bow, the other surfaced on the starboard side so close we could have reached out and touched its barnacle covered skin. We have been whale watching several times, but we have never had an experience like this! So close, and the whales just seemed to be curious about “the intruders” into their beautiful calm bay. At some point I just told myself to put down the camera, put my hands in my pockets, and just enjoy this rare experience. Some memories will just have to live in my mind.</p>
<p>After returning to the ship and sorting through the photos from this morning I favorited more than 50! Gotta be a little more choosy for this post, so here you go.</p>

			 <p>This morning the waves were larger than yesterday and the skies were much grayer. So we had another zodiac experience, but much bumpier and wetter than the previous day. While not as lucky as the day before, the highlight of this trip was to visit a Norwegian shipwreck.</p>
<p>Although called Enterprise island, this island was originally named Nansen island, after the Norwegian explorer and Nobel winner Fridtjof Nansen. (Yes, Luther friends, that one). But the British decided it would be better called Enterprise. The ship itself was here from Norway to help the whalers in the area stick it to the Brit’s. It had a processing system on board that would turn the whale blubber into oil, thus avoiding a particular British tax on whale blubber.</p>
<p>The pictures from this morning are all from Jane. I didn’t take our larger camera because we were warned that we and everything we took was likely to get rather wet. And it was fine, sometimes it is good to just take in the experience and not worry about getting photos every few minutes.</p>

<p><em>Cute little penguin</em></p>
<p><em>Penguin Personality</em></p>
<p><em>Penguins are stinky</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We could smell the colony of Gentoo penguins long before we could see them. And then we were there amongst them all. The wind was blowing hard and it was snowing. It was kind of miserable to be honest. But we had come to see the penguins and we were treated to a show. We saw them sliding down the hill, or just “swimming” through the snow. Some were laying on eggs. If they are on the rocks and laying they are on their egg. Some were swimming in the water. Several of them jumped up out of the water onto the rocks right where we were getting off the Zodiac! Curious little buggers.</p>

			 <p>This afternoon’s excursion was a zodiac cruise, rather than a hike. Everything we saw we saw from the side of the boat. We were lucky enough to have our Excursion Leader Jonathan as our zodiac driver, so we had a super knowledgeable guide for the trip.</p>
<p>The main highlight was a couple of crab seals. One was sleeping and molting, but another was awake and a bit more active and we saw him dive into the water. He resurfaced again and we were hopeful he would climb back on to his little iceberg but he decided to keep swimming. We learned that these seals have teeth that they can use to hunt seals, but they are all kind of trident shaped and when the seal closes its mouth it acts like a mesh. So a seal can gulp up a huge mouthful of water containing krill and then close its mouth, expel all of the water through the teeth, and it is left with a yummy mouthful of fresh krill. This is exactly what Baleen whales do on a much larger scale!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/ant06755.png" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/ant06779.png" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/ant06773.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We also learned a little about how to read the history of an iceberg. Since the ice on an iceberg melts faster than the ice out of the water bergs will often rotate many times. You can see on this one how that is the case. They call the left of the on pictured below the keel. And you can see the rings on the right as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/ant06768.png" alt=""></p>
<p>On this one you can see how the center of gravity has shifted more to the right, lifting the thinner part up out of the water on the left.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/ant06775.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Today was really quite a day. The guides all told us at recap that we had been extremely lucky and we had seen about 75% of the things we were likely to see in an entire trip in a single day! Which was funny because I had just commented that if for some reason we suddenly had to leave today, I would still have counted the trip a great success. I’m glad that we will have more days to see and re-see so many interesting things.</p>

			 <p>Achievement Unlocked - seventh continent visited.</p>
<p>This morning was very exciting! We awoke to a sunny day, and very calm seas knowing that in just a short time we would be taking our very first hike on Antarctica. A colony of Chinstrap penguins and a little climb to a beautiful overlook. There were humpback whales, just chilling, off the bow of the ship. What a day!</p>
<p>We went through the drill of putting on our wellingtons and parka, hat, gloves, life jacket, backpack… I felt like the Michelin Man. We had our first experience with the automatic boot scrubber (to keep contaminants off the continent) and got onto the zodiac. It was a short ride, but the excitement began to build early when a bunch of penguins started jumping out of the water just ahead of us. Once we got on land there was a path to follow to allow us to see many views of the colony without getting too close. I’m definitely glad we invested in the new lens. We were well back from the penguins but the lens makes it look like we were much closer. So, walking in the snow, enjoying the views… There is not much more to write so I’ll just share some of my favorite photos from the morning.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>How many oceans are there on earth? Most of us learned about four - Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic. But there is a fifth called the southern ocean that surrounds Antarctica. We need to get across it. This is also often referred to as the Drake passage. The winds have free rein to go all the way around the earth unimpeded by any content in this region. So, yeah, swells, big ones. And, uhhhhh seasickness for many many passengers.</p>
<p>I’m getting a little ahead of the story, but the early morning trip to the airport and the charter flight to Ushuaia were uneventful and pretty uninteresting. After arriving we took a motor coach tour of Tierra del Fuego, which was interesting since we had been there before with much more time to hike, so we kept trying to remember exactly where we had hiked. We pulled up to our yacht at 3:00 and were among the first passengers welcomed aboard. No lines, no reception checkin. Here’s a glass of champagne! Sit on the couch here and let me scan your passport and take your picture on my phone. OK, here’s your key, you are now checked in! We were scheduled to leave at 6pm but we were told that due to the holiday things were running behind. By the time we headed to bed right after dinner we were still in port. We were too tired to care, and we slept until 8AM the next morning. Between the time change and the lack of sleep it felt great.</p>
<p>At our first briefing of the day we learned that not only had we left late, but we had also picked up 20 passengers from our sister ship that was having engine trouble after passing through a storm on the Drake passage days ago. We learned more about our excursions off the ship and that the first three rules are “be flexible” The captain and the expedition leader work together to find the best, safest, most interesting landing spots for the day. With changing conditions that is often not known until hours before we are told and ready to go. We were so impressed with the expedition crew! Lots of specialties and advanced degrees in all kinds of fields will be leading us.</p>
<p>By the time of this first briefing we were well into the Drake and there were a LOT of seasick passengers. I know I am not immune to it, but I am lucky that I don’t get seasick easily, so far so good. Jerry and Jane have not felt the best but thankfully they haven’t got sick either.</p>
<p>Later in the day we got fit for our parkas, life jackets and boots that we will wear whenever we leave the ship. We also had a fascinating lecture about the Albatross in the drake passage. This is the best place in the world to see them, and we have enjoyed watching them soar and dive amongst the swells. They can literally fly for up to 9000 miles without stopping. With their 12 foot wingspan they are some of the largest birds in the world. Unfortunately they are endangered. As creatures of the sea (they are only on land to breed and hatch and care for their young) they have been really affected by plastics in the ocean, and by bad fishing practices. Eat your seafood responsibly people! And, do what you can to reduce your use of plastics.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/dsc06599.png" alt="My first photo of an Albatross"></p>
<p>By dinner time we were all feeling pretty good. We had a very nice meal and enjoyed some after dinner entertainment by our cruise director before turning in for another good nights sleep. The winds and the swells were predicted to increase during the night, and that proved to be the case. We were definitely rocked and rolled to sleep. Waking up a few times as the bottles in the mini-bar all clanged together. During the recap briefing we were asked to predict when we would see the first iceberg. Not “bergy bits” or pieces of floating ice, but a real true titanic size iceberg!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/dsc06613.png" alt="Our first iceberg"></p>
<p>I didn’t expect to see one on day two, but there it was just after lunch! I was looking out the window of our room and for a moment thought it was another ship in the distance, but once I got the binoculars it was clear that it was a berg.</p>
<p>Of course the other side of the ship had an even bigger one to see!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/dsc06610.png" alt="Iceberg 2."></p>
<p>We still have a good long distance to go before reaching Antarctica, but things are going to get more and more interesting.</p>

			 <p>We decided to splurge and book our overnight flight to Buenos Aires as Delta One tickets. There are some nice perks with that. Easy drop off of checked luggage and access to the Delta lounge while you wait. The seats lie totally flat for the overnight flight. Maybe we will be able to sleep, we thought. Not so much as it turns out. But we made it, having left Minneapolis at 3:00pm on Tuesday we arrived at 9 something the next morning in BA. An hour to get through customs and an hour to get downtown in a cab, It was pouring rain, the hotel lobby was packed with people waiting to leave on their Viking cruise. And our room was not ready, to be fair checkin was not until 3, and we were not the only tired travelers arriving on an overnight flight.</p>
<p>We had booked a bike tour to keep us going in the afternoon, but that was cancelled due to the rain. So we hung out in the lobby, watched some soccer, and had a light lunch waiting for our room or for our friends Ann and Jerry to arrive.</p>
<p>The highlight of that first day was the dinner experience we booked at Fogon. Everything is cooked with the highly elaborate Argentine grill called a perilla. There are 9 courses on the menu, but the 2 surprise courses brought the number to 11.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/8177e8a9-e674-49d3-80c3-e0b0d8b6b43f.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/img-8758.png" alt="The Parilla"></p>
<p>The chefs were all very friendly and very entertaining. The food was absolutely delicious and a celebration of being a wine loving carnivore.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/img-8768.png" alt="Smoked “eyebrow” with a pinecone"></p>
<p>Our dinner didn’t start until 7:30 which is very early for the Argentines, and it ended sometime after 10 when most of them are just getting started. We were glad to get back to the hotel and put our overstuffed bodies to bed for the night. We had an all day tour of the city booked for the morning beginning at 9:30. Note that Buenos Aires is 3 hours ahead of Minneapolis so we were not too jet lagged, but still quite sleep deprived.</p>
<p>The tour of BA was fabulous, our tour guide’s name was Fabio and he was both knowledgeable and an excellent story teller. We had lots of questions and he seemed to really thrive on our back and forth. Our first stop of the day was at the government center. It was a big day/weekend as they were inaugurating a new mayor as well as a new president. Our impression was that this new president was going to be a trump-like disaster for Argentina, but it seems most people remain hopeful, that he will be an influence for change but moderated by the legislature that he must work with. Democracy in Argentina over the years has not been easy with many coups and rebellions. I won’t try to recap it all in this post, but I feel compelled to re-watch Evita with a new perspective. We did see the balcony that Eva Peron and Madonna both used.</p>
<p>Speaking of Evita our second stop was at the cemetery where she is interred. Her mausoleum is one of the most visited places in the city. This cemetery is just amazing as everyone is in some kind of crypt or mausoleum. When a family buys a place there they own it forever, but if they stop maintaining the site then it begins to decay. So we saw many amazing graves and many that had been grand years ago that were now full of spider webs and weeds. It was like a small town all to itself with streets and avenues going all over.</p>
<p>Having had our fill of beef the night before we politely asked Fabio for a different option for lunch. He pulled through and brought us to a small family run place that made killer empanadas. By this time it was well after 1 and we didn’t finish lunch until 3. We still had one more stop on our tour!</p>
<p>The highlight of the final stop was a drive by of the stadium where the Boca Juniors play. The club of Maradonna! The blue and yellow colors of the teem seemed oddly familiar to me, and I’ll tell you why. It seems that there were two teams in the city with the same colors, and they had a match to see who could keep the current colors, the loser would have to choose new colors. The Bocas lost, and the owners declared that they would adopt the colors of the next ship to dock in the harbor. That ship turned out to be flying the Swedish flag!</p>
<p>It was 5pm by the time we arrived back at the hotel. We were going to have dinner, and then take in a Tango show which didn’t start until 10! On top of that our bus to the airport for our charter flight to Ushuaia was going to be leaving between 4:30 and 5:00 AM the next morning!! Sound a little crazy? Well, we made it through, and are enjoying a couple of down days on the journey to Antarctica to catch up on sleep. More on that in the next post.</p>
<p>The dinner was pretty forgettable, and 3 out of 4 of us enjoyed the Tango show. OK, the music was good, I just have never learned to appreciate dance. For me the show could have ended after an hour but it kept going for another 40 minutes with various flourishes and bows and a dramatic rendition of “Don’t cry for me Argentina” to wrap up the show. It was after midnight by the time we walked back to our hotel, and yes, the alarm needed to be set for 4:15AM. There will be time to sleep later.</p>

			 <p>Today started out with another harrowing drive.  We received about 3 inches of snow overnight, so my first duty was to clear the snow off the car.  The snow was melting off the streets and it was warm enough that I really wasn&rsquo;t worried about the drive.  Until we started up the million dollar highway, on snowy, icy, roads, with no guard rails!  We were doing 5-10 miles per hour on some parts.  Luckily once we reached the summit things improved dramatically, but it was a very long first hour of driving.</p>
<p>The highway was built in the 1880s to connect Silverton with Ouray.  It is supposed to be stunningly beautiful.  Hopefully we can return in the warmer months to find out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>From Silverton we continued on to Durango and then Mesa Verde National Park.  It was a great time of the year to visit as the crowds were pretty small.  The downside is that the ranger led tours of the cliff dwellings had ended a few weeks ago.  Still, we were able to see a lot of the detail of the construction extremely well.</p>

<p>Mesa Verde, Machu Picchu, and other ancient constructions always astonish me. How could they have done all of that building?  So much progress in engineering that seems to have been lost.  What happened?</p>

			 <p>Today began just North of Denver, dry roads and a cloudy sky.  We had coffee and got our day started, we were on the road by 8:00.  Our path today would take us to Ouray with a stop at Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park. Not our usual route out of Denver, up I70, but rather down US285 and over Monarch pass. Not more than 20 minutes down the road the conditions changed drastically.  Cars in the ditch and ice on the roads.  We slowed our progress considerably and soon the ice changed to water, but the skies got cloudier and the snow started.  The conditions were not too bad until we climbed up toward Monarch pass.  A pickup (pulling a camper!) had slid off the road, we slowed way down and joined a line of other like-minded travelers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Once we were over the pass, the temperatures warmed above freezing and the roads thawed and the sun came out.  We paused for lunch at the Alpine Brewing company in Gunnison.  We continued west toward Montrose but took a detour slightly North to take in Black Canyon NP.  It was cloudy and we could hear thunder in the distance.  Its odd to look down on the clouds in the Valley.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I kind of felt like maybe I could hear the dwarves from the Lord of the Rings.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The thunder got louder and closer, and before we knew it it was sleeting like crazy.  In less than five minutes the roads were completely covered in slushy ice.  But once again as we descended slowly the roads cleared.</p>
<p>We continued on our way toward Ouray and were treated to a beautiful sight as the  clouds briefly cleared.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Our evening in Ouray was pretty uneventful.  We walked around downtown, but it was pretty quiet as it was cold and rainy.  We had dinner at Brickhouse 737 in Ouray and it was a great meal.  Quite a nice change from breweries and other on the road meals.</p>

It seems really weird for us to hear people wishing other people a Happy Thanksgiving on a Monday, much less in early October!  But it was a day to be thankful for after all!</p>
<p>We started our day by visiting Niagara Falls!  Our first stop was the behind the falls experience.  It was a little unnerving to walk through a tunnel realizing how much water was flowing just feet over your head!  But the sights were quiet nice.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We thought the view from above was even better.  This is one of my favorites!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The Canadians clearly were lucky in that you can see Horseshoe falls as well as the American falls so much better from the Canadian side.</p>

<p>The afternoon was a fun afternoon of wine tasting in the Niagara region.  Starting with the Wayne Gretzgy distillery and ending with a very nice pork chop on our grill back at the camp ground. At this point vacation is basically over and we have two days of driving to get back to Decorah.  I&rsquo;m almost sure the adventure is not over yet.  So stay tuned for further updates.</p>

			 <p>After a fitful night of sleep due to the on again off again rain, and in between the rain the wind blowing the rain out of the trees along with many leaves.  We finally got up and decided to head down the road.  It was just lightly raining when we broke camp, but as we drove west toward Syracuse NY we drove in and out of fairly heavy rain.  Nothing nearly as bad as the moment we arrived at our campground!</p>
<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t be a good trip if you didn&rsquo;t get to use your raincoat.  So we put them on and used the dump station and added some fresh water.  Do I look happy or what?</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When we found our site, it was basically a shallow river.  Despite our excellent rain coats we were pretty wet by the time we got backed in and leveled up.  I was wearing my crocs for some dumb reason so my feet ended up soaked too.  I decided to do some work, which was a mistake, as something broke, so I couldn&rsquo;t run my Saturday updates.</p>
<p>We thought about heading out to a brewery for dinner and the hope of watching MNUFC take on LA Galaxy.  In the end our internet was good enough that we decided to make chili and stay in.  The Loons miraculously won, so that is something.  Their playoff hopes, however dim, are still alive.</p>
<p>The morning was cool and partly sunny but very windy.  I spent the morning working on my problem and finally found the solution I needed.  Jane took a walk around the campground.  We had hoped to bike along the Erie Canal, but it was way too windy and cool.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Then I got the board book for the Luther board meeting and saw the schedule for Thursday, so we called another audible and decided to head out to Niagara Falls today, which will allow us to arrive in Decorah on Wednesday instead of Thursday.  You gotta stay flexible when you are on the road.</p>

			 <p>Onward to New Hampshire!  We have turned the corner and started heading back west.  We got to Acadia a day early to try to maximize the nice weather, and are doing the same to try to enjoy some New Hampshire &ldquo;leaf peeping.&rdquo; Personally I&rsquo;ve now done enough leaf peeping to last me a while, but everywhere you turn there are hillsides full of vibrant colors.  Jane has a higher level of enthusiasm and can&rsquo;t get enough of the leaves.</p>
<p>Here is a beautiful view from &ldquo;Height of the Land,&rdquo; one of our first stops in New Hampshire.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We arrived at our campground at Franconia Notch State Park.  It is a very compact campground and took a lot of fancy driving for Jane to get our camper backed into our spot.  Its one of the most unlevel spots we have had and took some stacking skill on my part to get us level left to right.  But it was a beautiful site, with a nice fire pit.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After a long day of driving it felt good to go for a short hike at Artists Bluff.  It was a good workout of climbing over rocks to get to the top where we could see hill sides in every direction, a small pond and even some of the ski slopes. It had turned quite windy so we didn&rsquo;t stay on the bluff as long as we might.</p>
<p>Instead we headed back to camp, got a couple of bundles of wood, and made a nice campfire with happy hour and some burgers on the horizon.  This will be our last campsite with no electric hookup.  Also no place to dump, so we&rsquo;ll have to haul our gray and black water with us to New York.</p>
<p>We have reservations for three nights, but we are anticipating leaving a day earlier as it is supposed to rain and we can drive to Syracuse and break up the drive to Niagara.</p>
<p>The highlight of day 2 at Franconia Notch was the hike to the Flume Gorge.  This was a fun hike through a granite and basalt gorge.  covered bridges and walkways.  Fall colors were everywhere despite the overcast day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When the hike was over we still had a drive on the &ldquo;Kanck&rdquo;. A well known highway with lots of turnouts.  This weekend is a long weekend with Columbus day and Canadian Thanksgiving, which seems to be widely celebrated in the Northeast.  So it is one of the busiest weekends of the year for leaf peepers. But despite the crowds there was plenty of beauty to go around.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We stopped for lunch in North Conway at a restaurant that was featured on Diners Drive-ins and Dives called Barley and Salt.  We had the Thai chicken tacos which were really delicious and which I am determined to recreate when I have more than a camper kitchen to work with.</p>
<p>By the time we got back to the camper, which was round 6pm it was starting to rain so we packed up the chairs and had everything stowed and ready to take off in the morning.  The rainy night was a perfect night to use some of the left over ragu in the freezer.  We both feel like we we are in the home stretch now.  We will be in Decorah in six days.  The time has flown by, but looking back at our initial stops in New York feels like a long time ago!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I woke at 1:15AM, three and a half hours of sleep left.  Darn, I did math, now my brain is awake.  Breathe slowly and try to get back to sleep.  2:30, wonder what time it is now? 3:30, really? just sleep until the alarm goes off already! 4:30 both of us are awake but we might as well just lay here for 15 more minutes! Finally, my iPhone alarm goes off and I accidentally hit snooze &ndash; as if! I&rsquo;m so used to just waking up at 5:30 every morning, that when I need to set an alarm to get up earlier my whole system breaks down.  So why all of the fuss?</p>
<p>We had a reservation to watch the sunrise on Cadillac mountain!  It is the first place to see the sun come up in the USA.  I guess that is a cool feature.  The recommendation from all of Jane&rsquo;s research was to get there an hour <strong>before</strong> sunrise, which was very good advice because of course the sky starts to glow well before.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It is so cool to be sitting up there looking at the ocean and all of the little islands, and everyone around you is whispering, because its dark and nobody wants to spoil the vibe.  We watch a cruise ship come into the area waiting to deposit its passengers in Bar Harbor for the day.  We hear lots of fishing boats heading out, and we can see lots of moving points of light on the water.</p>
<p>We can tell there are some clouds on the horizon so there should be some nice color.  And there is!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>6:35 comes and the sun is obscured by the clouds on the horizon, but we wait a bit longer and are rewarded with a glorious sunrise!  The volume level goes up all around us, and people leave their spots and start wandering around more.  Everyone seems very happy!  A beautiful sunrise and the promise of a new day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What a great way to start your morning. Next we think that maybe some Popovers from the cafe at Jordan&rsquo;s pond might be a good way to celebrate a successful sunrise, so we stop, but sadly they do not open until 9.  It is only 7:30, so we head back to the camper for some pancakes instead.</p>
<p>Later some more hiking and another trip to Bar Harbor to find the internet.  My coffee grinder has broken down, so I&rsquo;ll try to see if I can find a replacement or at least by some ground coffee for future mornings.  We only have a week left, time has gone so quickly.</p>

			 <p>Lets get going by 9 Jane said.  No problem, time for coffee and morning puzzles etc.  My watch and phone said it was only about 8:15 and Jane was pacing, &ldquo;ready??&rdquo;  Her iPad said it was 9:15.  Some of our devices had not made the switch from Atlantic to Eastern timezone. Not surprising given the lack of internet connectivity around Acadia.</p>
<p>The result was that we got an early start on our hike up the Beehive Trail, which was good because we definitely beat the rush.  Here are some pics to highlight our hike/climb.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Yep, this hike features vertical climbs up metal rungs.  A couple were even past vertical.  I must admit that the pictures definitely look more dangerous than it felt at the time.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The climb was definitely worth it as you could see forever, and it was beautiful.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With the hike finished we headed back to the camper.  The sun and solar panels had already done their job of recharging the batteries for the camper.  We had worked up an appetite so I cooked some hash browns, bacon and scrambled eggs on the griddle.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Acadia has highways, park roads, and carriage roads.  The last are thanks to the Rockefeller&rsquo;s from way back.  The carriage roads are for bikers and hikers and horses only.  So it is a great way to see the park free from traffic.  Getting to the carriage roads from our campground, however, is a bit of a challenge.  We had to start on one of the park roads for a few miles and then walk our bikes up the bank to the carriage road once we got there.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We really enjoyed Jordan&rsquo;s pond and Eagle Lake and the Bubble Pond&hellip;  The fall colors were really brilliant</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The last bit of our ride was back to hiking.  To get from the carriage road to the highway that brings us back to our campground required some fancy maneuvering!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>With plenty of exercise for the day, we rested for a few minutes and then went in to Bar Harbor where we had a dinner reservation.  Bar Harbor was <strong>busy</strong> I can&rsquo;t imagine what it is like there during the summer months.  But we found a brewery with good WiFi to catch up on a few things and then walked around the shops before heading to Geddy&rsquo;s for some calamari and pizza.</p>
<p>It was not a late night, as we need to get up at 4:45AM to drive up to Cadillac mountain to watch the sunrise&hellip;</p>

			 <p>Halifax has a nice food scene and a pretty boardwalk along the bay.  We saw several cruise ships leave and arrive, and got to try a local specialty.  A Donair.</p>
<p>A Halifax Donair shares some history with a Gyro, except that they are made from beef and have a special Halifax sauce.  Crispy thin sliced beef with a creamy, sweet, garlic sauce with plenty of tomatoes and onions.  We split one from a shop on the boardwalk so as not to spoil our appetites for Jane&rsquo;s birthday dinner.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The boardwalk was fine, but I wouldn&rsquo;t say spectacular.  We found a nice Irish pub for some drinks, and they had a live band.  So it was fun to sit and listen.  Not as cool as the ceilidh back on Cape Breton, but still good.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Birthday dinner was at The Bicycle Thief restaurant.  It was a very nice meal, Jane had Seared Atlantic Halibut with brown butter &amp; parmigiano fregola, charred asparagus, vino bianco, roasted sweet tomatoes, lemon &amp; caper beurre blanc.  I had Old-School Lobster Thermidor, Whole NS Lobster, wild mushrooms, shallots, Brandy crema, gratinéed with breadcrumbs, gruyère &amp; parmigiano, truffle spaghettini &amp; fresh asparagus.  Both were delicious.  We had a nice bottle of Chardonnay from Long Meadow Range in Anderson Valley.  For desert we split the Creme brulee&hellip; slightly warm, with a really crispy crust, in short perfect.  Top that off with a little sip of Port or Courvoisier and you have completed a near perfect meal.</p>

			 <p>The plan was to bike about 14 miles to Lunenburg, have some lunch at a brewery, and then bike back to where we parked. Drive back to the camper and make some Peruvian chicken for dinner. That was the plan. It was a beautiful day, It was a beautiful ride, although the trail was a bit soft in a number of places, and in a few it was completely washed out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>However, 15 miles into the 14 mile ride we called a halt to consult the map.  Somewhere along the way we had missed a turn that we didn&rsquo;t even know to look for.  Now we were almost to Bridgewater, quite a distance from Lunenburg.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What to do now?  Trying to make a triangle out of the situation was not a good solution.  No trails from here to there, and the distance would have made the ride too long.  So, we decide to turn back, maybe stop at a brewery along the way back, and see where to go.  Riding along and discussing the options further, we decide to just head back to the truck and then drive from there to Lunenburg.  Jane really wanted to see Lunenburg as it is a UNESCO site.</p>
<p>To get there we had to drive through Mahone Bay.   What a zoo!  We drove into their annual Scarecrow Festival!  People everywhere.  Cars everywhere. Astronaut scarecrows, firefighter scarecrows, They were everywhere.  Kind of funny and clever.  One of the few things we didn&rsquo;t take a picture of, sadly.</p>
<p>Eventually we made it to Lunenburg where we found a good viewpoint to take a photo of the town, with its colorful buildings and tall ships in the harbor.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Around four O&rsquo;clock we parked and walked to the Shipwreck Brewery tap room.  The smell of pizza was a little overwhelming as we walked in! We hadn&rsquo;t much to eat, and had just ridden 30 miles. After looking at the menu we decided the chicken could wait!  One small pizza and one lobster roll to go with our beers please.</p>

			 <p>I have to admit I was a little whiney.  Not yet 7am and Jane was ready to go.  It was barely even light outside.  But we had to get going.  We are driving the Cabot Trail today, around Cape Breton island including many many short stops in Cape Breton Highlands National Park.  Spoiler alert&hellip; even though I was a bit grumpy starting out this was one of my favorite days.  This drive is just so beautiful.   In Jane&rsquo;s notes it was described by some other blogger as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Cabot Trail is a road that hugs the Gulf of St. Lawrence on the rugged northwestern edge of Nova Scotia, where around every bend you want to pull over, spew expletives of joy at the stupendous vista, and take another snapshot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our first fun stop was to take the worlds shortest ferry ride on the Englishtown ferry.  We had a lovely chat with the ferryman during our three minute crossing which covered everything from the state of education to English Premier League football, to the relative strength of various hurricanes, to whether the Packers (he saw our Wisconsin license plate) would win their Thursday night football game.  We covered a lot of ground!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Our next stop was Middle head.  A really nice hike which we cut short because we were still worried about time.  Jane had read that it was really difficult to get the whole loop done in a day</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After that it was just turnout after turnout of stopping to take in the scenery.  Our next real goal was to do the Skyline hike.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The skyline hike was four miles out and back.  With a set of boardwalk steps at the end that give you a pretty spectacular view of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>More scenery followed the Skyline hike&hellip;until we arrived in Cheticamp, where we decided to stop for lunch at the Doryman&rsquo;s pub, rather than eat another day&rsquo;s worth of turkey and salami sandwiches.  We had a great view of the bay and I had fish and chips and Jane had chowder. The chowder was great. My irish red ale was also very good.  We think that our waitress secretly could not believe that Jane would like the IPA she ordered and so brought her a bud light instead.</p>
<p>At the end of the trail, Jane made a &ldquo;wrong turn&rdquo; that led us to the Big Spruce brewery instead of our camp ground.  We enjoyed a couple of pints before heading back to relax for the evening.  We made a campfire, thanks to our neighbor who gave us some nice dry kindling and paper to get it going!  We were still very full from our mid afternoon meal that we warmed up some leftover pizza on the Traeger for an evening snack.</p>

			 <p>Last night we had a fabulous dinner experience!  On Prince Edward Island there is an old church, that once was a barn, but is now a restaurant.  It is open every night for dinner for one seating of around 20 people. Their menu says they are &ldquo;a love letter to Canadian food and wine.&rdquo; The menu changes every week, and they don&rsquo;t repeat, ever, at least not in 8 years.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>All the foods are local, that is they use ingredients from PEI that mostly come from just a few km away.  They don&rsquo;t use any ingredients that are not grown in Canada.  So, no lemon, or lime, or black pepper.  Instead they make pepper from the flower cluster of the Green Alder, They are super creative and the food was just awesome.  One of the highlights of the night was the Halibut.  One of their friends/suppliers, a fisherman, showed up on their door a couple of days ago to let them know he had a 50 pound Halibut he had just caught, he thought they might want it.  We are glad they did!</p>
<p>The kitchen area is open for everyone to see the small staff working to prepare the next course.  And before you eat the course the chef explains what you are getting.  Then as you are eating he walks around to answer questions or just chat with every table.  They pair each course with a Canadian wine. The result is a 7 course meal that goes from 5:30 - 9pm, a beautiful night of food and drink.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ol>
<li>roasted carrots, marinated carrots, cows&rsquo;s blue cheese fritters, basil aioli.  The blue cheese fritters (Choux batter with blue cheese mixed in) were better than any fried cheese curds I&rsquo;ve had in my life!</li>

<ol start="4">
<li>belle river rock crab mezzalunes, charred tomato aioli, cured egg yolk.  What? Cured egg yolk salted and dried and then they grate it over the pasta!  I&rsquo;m gonna try it.</li>

<ol start="7">
<li>geoff&rsquo;s apples, maple granola, mint oil, whipped sweet clover cheesecake.
The apples were warm, but still crunchy, and the whipped cheesecake was like a thick whipped cream.  A delicious ending.</li>

<p>Jane&rsquo;s favorites:  The carrots and the Halibut</p>
<p>Brad&rsquo;s favorites: The Halibut, the carrots were a big surprise and the fritters were just so good. Learning about cured egg yolks.</p>

			 <p>This morning we woke up at almost 7AM (Atlantic Time) way late for us usually.  I lost whatever unspoken contest we had, and got out of bed to turn on the heater!  We like keeping the heat off overnight and sleeping in the cold rather than having the heat kick on and off.</p>
<p>We decided to drive to the beach to see if we could see more than last night, and we ended up finding a very nice board walk with some great views</p>

<p>From there it was only a 3 hour drive to our campground on Prince Edward Island.  I can&rsquo;t imaging what a zoo this place must be during the summer but at this time of the year it was very quiet.  They had assigned us a pretty lousy campsite but the nice person checking us in just said to drive around and pick whatever spot we liked, and give her a call on the off chance that someone else was going to be here and had booked that site.  Even with all of that it took us more than an hour to get situated.  The sites were so uneven and once we got the camper in a decent position the steps would not go down far enough!  In and out, up and down&hellip; Usually it takes us about 10 minutes to back in and level up.  It took us almost an hour!</p>
<p>We had hoped to bike, but it was very cloudy and windy today so we didn&rsquo;t have any desire to bike.  So we drove the coastline, and around the area.  Here&rsquo;s a very attractive photo of the shoreline with a not so attractive picture of my shirt blowing in the wind.</p>

<p>The National Park closed last week, and things have shut down very quickly.  So most of the shops and attractions were closed for the season.  Thankfully our dinner place for the evening was not one of them!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was a four course dinner experience.  You got a 1 pound lobster plus unlimited chowder and mussels and salad and desert.  it was all very good and we had the nicest server who talked with us and answered all of our questions about the area.  This place goes through 20,000 pounds of lobster and 90,000 pounds of mussels every year.  They have a huge lobster holding area that they feed with fresh and salt water to keep them happy/slightly sedated before they are cooked for us.  The mussels are also locally &ldquo;cultivated&rdquo; and were delicous.</p>
<p>Here I am diligently working on my Lobster!

			 <p>No I haven&rsquo;t suddenly become a Rascal Flatts fan!  But 40km into the 120km stretch of NB 108 (New Brunswick 108 East) that phrase came into my mind.  Why?  Because it is quite possibly the worst stretch of highway we have ever been directed to drive by any maps application ever.  Not counting the horrible dike road incident at <a href="https://reputablejournal.com/2021/10/21/google-maps-you.html">Lake Chilcot Arkansas</a> in 2021.  That was clearly not a highway.  The first warning was that there was no gas or service for 120km.  The next bad sign was that the speed limit was 80km/h but we couldn&rsquo;t drive more than about 50!  The road was <strong>broken</strong>!  When Jane posted on the RV group about our experience this was the reply.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who or what gave you the option of taking the 108? When it was called the Renous shortcut way back when, that road was take at your own risk, things have not changed.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The road was <strong>broken</strong> for miles and miles.</p>
<p>But God bless it!! it was beautiful.   And totally devoid of cell service!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Our stomachs (and bladders) were churning from the bumps so badly that we stopped at the first gas station 1.7 km from the end of the road.  But their network was down.  So gas was cash only.  Ummm we have some US$ but very few loonies.  Thankfully gas (at least petrol) was not the point of the stop. So we moved on.  Never have we been so happy to get on a smooth highway!</p>
<p>And we arrived at the Kouchibouguac campground on Saint-Louis Lagoon on the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  Eight hours after our six hour drive started.  But&hellip; this is why we call it an adventure!  You never know what you are going to encounter&hellip;</p>
<p>Our first order of business after getting the camper settled, by which I mean picking up everything that was strewn all over the floor. Everything from an entire box of frozen meat from the freezer to cans of soda and ice trays.  What a mess.   After getting it all cleaned up we decided to walk down the trail toward Kelly&rsquo;s beach&hellip; Unfortunately we discovered that the bridge to the beach had been removed for the season!  Grrrr 2.2 km of constant mosquitos for <strong>nothing</strong>!  Adventure!  We turned around and headed back to the camper.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve missed a couple of days along the way, so with today being a &ldquo;day of rest&rdquo; I thought I could catch us up.</p>
<h2 id="corning">Corning</h2>
<p>This is going way back, but I did forget to write about our trip to the Corning Museum of Glass.  Very very cool.  We are not &ldquo;museum people&rdquo; but this was fun, educational, interesting, interactive, &hellip; Who knew there was so much different science and engineering behind &ldquo;glass!&rdquo;  We started with a glass etching experience and then went to the hot shop to see them blow a huge glass light fixture.  If you have never seen a glass blowing demonstration you really should.  Mathematics, Physics, Art, Engineering, it&rsquo;s all there.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here is Jane etching her glass.  I made a Runestone glass!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="montreal">Montreal</h2>
<p>We drove from Stowe to Montreal, beautiful scenery but we are still too early for the change in color.  We knew that going in that we were likely too early for some places and would be too late for others by the time we were finished.  But it was pretty.  Kind of funny crossing the border.  I know it&rsquo;s no joke, But kind of odd to the average tourist. Do you have any firearms?  No. Do you own any firearms? No.  Do you have any defensive weapons&hellip; like pepper spray or a hunting knife?  Ummm no.  Does the hatchet for splitting wood count?  What about my chef&rsquo;s knife?  We are towing a camper after all.  Then there were the questions about alcohol&hellip; Of course we have some wine in the camper.  Are you visiting anyone? No. Do you know anyone? No. Will you meet anyone?  Ummm, I imagine we might meet people while we are camping or eating out&hellip; it&rsquo;s hard to not meet people.</p>
<p>My vision of Montreal was influenced way to much by the Canada pavilion at EPCOT.  It was nice, but felt more big city than anything, even in old town.  It was cool to see the city at sunset, especially the Olympic stadium in the distance.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In the morning we took a short bike ride, and got an even better view.  A very cool structure.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Maybe the oddest thing we saw was a driver missing the corner and plowing into the retaining wall right on the edge of a restaurant.  People pulled out their phones and started filming, then the driver and the passenger tried to switch places.  It was hard to tell what was going on, and we had to catch our ferry so we didn&rsquo;t wait until the police came.</p>
<p>Just before we fell asleep Jane said “I smell skunk”. Yes, there it was the distinct smell of skunk.  Was there a skunk under the camper?  Did one of the stray cats around the campground get into it with a skunk and was now lurking around our campsite?  Should I go out into the dark and try to figure it out?  In the words of Marlin Perkins “I’ll stay safely in the camper”  We will never know, the smell was gone in the morning.</p>
<h2 id="quebec-city">Quebec City</h2>
<p>Quebec city definitely had more of an old European vibe to it!  We enjoyed our walk, even if it did involve over 310 stairs!  We walked and wandered and then enjoyed a wonderful Italian dinner in the upper town.  After dinner we made our way back through the streets toward the ferry.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And enjoyed the view of Château Frontenac as we headed across the river.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Today is mostly a day of rest, doing laundry and catching up on some work&hellip; But we did get in a 26 mile ride along the river this afternoon.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You can see Château Frontenac in the daylight along with a couple of cruise ships.  We also saw the last bridge across the river as we head toward the ocean.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The plan for tonight is to relax, have a some burgers at our campsite, and prepare for a long (8 hour) drive tomorrow to New Brunswick.  We will be happy to get back to a province where English is the dominant language!  It has been so long since we have visited a country where we do not speak the accepted/dominant language.  Of course the Canadians are very welcoming, friendly, nice, and do their best to understand us.  Especially if we try to greet them in French or say a few words.  TIL that when you are biking in Quebec you can&rsquo;t expect people to understand &ldquo;on your left&rdquo; instead one should say &ldquo;à ta gauche&rdquo;  I&rsquo;m not sure &ldquo;on your left&rdquo; is a universal bike thing, or whether I&rsquo;m just really bad ad saying it, but it did not get the normal response!</p>

			 <p>Today our goal was to explore some of the other state parks and hikes near Watkins Glen, verifying whether Ithaca really is “Gorges”, and try out a few wineries on the shores of Cayuga lake. It was a good day!</p>
<p>We started out with the Gorge Hike at Robert Treman State Park. We were there early enough to get some beautiful morning light.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/img-7354.png" alt="The Gorge Hike at Robert Treman SP"></p>
<p>The hike takes you to the top of Lucifer Falls, and then you <strong>descend</strong> The view looking back and up is also amazing, but then you realize you have a lot of climbing to do to get back where you started. But it was such a beautiful morning and we almost had the trail to ourselves.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/img-7360.png" alt="Lucifer Falls from below"></p>
<p>After this hike we made a quick stop at Buttermilk Falls just on the edge of Ithaca.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/img-7365.png" alt="Buttermilk Falls"></p>
<p>We were noticing that the falls were a bit dry compared to the descriptions and other pictures we have seen.</p>
<p>Both Jane and I have been to Ithaca before, back when Kaia was doing her college search. But, that was in much cooler weather. It was nice to be able to explore. The motto of Ithaca is “Ithaca is gorges,” and it is a very pretty town, very hilly, but areas and paths along the waterfalls leading right to campus.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/img-7368.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/img-7376.png" alt="A beautiful walk from downtown to campus"></p>
<p>We headed over to the shore of Cayuga lake at Taughannock Falls state park. We at our sandwiches and enjoyed the lake, and I answered a couple of emails on my iPad. Our post lunch hike was to the falls. It was a nice flat hike leading back to the falls, where we also saw a group of Perigrine Falcons circling. These falcons can dive at speeds of 200mph to knock out their prey!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/img-7377.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Although high, the water flow at these falls was very low. So after our hike we continued north along the lake to check out some wineries: Sheldrake Point, the Thirsty Owl, and Buttonwood grove. All had great views of the lake so we could sip and enjoy the view. We thought that the Thirsty Owl should be introduced to the Thirsty Otter in Balsam Lake. We are learning that there are lots of good wines in the region if not what we are used to. Most are more of a German style like a dry Riesling or even a dry Gewurstraminer on the white side. While the reds tend to be a little more traditional, but with Cab Franck being a bit more prevalent. We definitely found something to like everywhere.</p>
<p>We finished our wine tasting a little too early to head back to town for a dinner out. So we stopped at a the Finger Lakes Distillery along the way to enjoy the waning sun and more lake views, and a cocktail.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/img-7380.png" alt="Finger Lakes Distillery"></p>
<p>Next stop Stowe Vermont!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We started this morning with a hike from the upper to middle to lower falls at Letchworth State Park, and ended with the Gorge hike at Watkins Glenn. What a great day of waterfalls!</p>
<p>I have already had to rethink my opinion of New York State, which is totally based on my experience with New York City and “New Yorkers”. The rural parts of New York are amazing!</p>
<p>We spent last night at Letchworth state park, which claims to be the number one state park in the USA. I don’t know how you can possibly back up such a claim, but as the pundits say, Letchworth belongs in the conversation! Beautiful, well kept, great hiking options &hellip;</p>
<p>I don’t think our neighbors would vote for it&hellip; When we pulled into our loop and saw the water station we pulled over&hellip; Before we got out of the truck a guy on a bike pulled up to tell us “some guy just jack-knifed his camper, and is blocking the road. You might want to take your time! So we did, and even then the poor couple was no closer to a solution. They had unhooked their truck from the camper but were trying to reconnect in completely the wrong way! Husband and wife were barely talking to each other. But they did offer to move so that we could try to get around. We did, and we were all settled before they got into their site.</p>
<p>We had not thought to take anything out of the freezer for dinner, so we took out a couple of stakes and I put them in the sous vide while we headed to Eddy’s to watch the sunset! It was very nice with a great view of the river gorge and the sun disappearing behind the bluffs!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/b36cfd59d3.jpeg" alt="Sunset in Letchworth State Park"></p>
<p>The morning was quite cool, we had to turn on the heat for a few minutes to take the chill out of the air. We dressed in layers and headed out towards middle and upper falls. Our plan was to hike from there down to the lower falls and back, about a 4 mile hike.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/96bf0175-4eab-4ea6-ab2f-4c493c79c6fb.jpeg" alt="Upper Falls"></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/1714fd26f9.jpeg" alt="Lower Falls"></p>
<p>It was a great morning for a hike. There was almost nobody else on the trail. We did meet a couple from Ohio who had just come from Watkins Glen, so they had good advice for us on how to do the gorge hike.</p>
<p>After showers and some tacos for lunch we packed up camp and headed for Watkins Glen. It was just a two hour drive, and on much better roads than the route we took to Letchworth!!</p>
<p>The campground sits high above the village of Watkins Glen, and the gorge hike starts way down low. So we descended and then started the long trek back upwards. But it was spectacular.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2023/d1b6f7ab-624d-4870-88d3-926e24dacf19.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>After all of that hiking and climbing we were definitely hungry and sleepy campers. We hooked up our fire pit, and sat around the fire with some warmed up pasta and wine and just relaxed. By bedtime a light rain had started so we had that sound to put us to sleep for the night.</p>

			 <p>Mostly just a travel day, but with a short hike at the end. Going through Chicago is never fun, but gave us the quote of the day from Jane: “Oh my gosh we are getting passed by an Oscar Meyer Weiner!”</p>

<p>The Indiana Dunes National Park is the newest National Park. It is located right along the shore of Lake Michigan, with plenty of beaches and sand dunes to explore. Here we are on the beach, Jane is pointing at downtown Chicago, which we could just make out through the haze.</p>

<p>It was a very nice campground, but no electricity so we decided to cook over an open fire. We had bought a bundle of wood at the gas station but it was very wet, so it was a struggle but we eventually had enough coals for some turkey burgers. It was a very nice night to enjoy the fire, but we have a long day of driving to get to New York so it was an early night.</p>

			 <p>I grew up in farm country so I&rsquo;m pretty familiar with how food gets to the grocery store.  But what about all the other stuff we buy at all the other stores?  Well here is a clue for you&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>One thing this trip through the panama canal has made me realize is just how amazing, complex, and expensive the global shipping system is.  Have you ever wondered how much it costs for a ship to go through the Panama canal?  Take a guess?  Our cruise ship cost about $370,000 and larger ships can cost over a million!</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t even begin to guess the value of everything in those containers but just think about it.  Cars, wood, electronics, furniture, carpet, gas, oil, grain, it all makes its way around the world in giant ships.  In Colon there is a huge duty free area where buyers go and order containers of various things. Oh, I like these shorts I&rsquo;ll take 2 containers of medium 1 of large, etc&hellip;</p>
<p>Going through the Panama canal you really see where this all comes together, literally, to fit through a bunch of locks that are a thousand feet long and 160 feet wide.  Plus the new locks for the even bigger ships.</p>
<p>Our route through the canal started at the Gatun locks.  These take you up 85 feet to lake Gatun. You can see our ship the Celebrity Millenium in the background just entering the first lock.  The white and blue ship is a car carrier heading the opposite direction.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here we are in the lock looking backward you can see a tanker heading out.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We then travelled across the lake (formed by damming the Chagres river) to the Pedro Miguel locks which stepped us down about 50 feet and then on the the Miraflores locks which took us down to the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>This sequence just shows us at the Miraflores locks dropping down the final step before we head out.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>Panama City in the background.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The whole thing is such an engineering marvel.  And not done with new technology!  Much of the canal has not changed since it was built over 100 years ago.  No pumps are used, it is all gravity fed.  Which means that in order for the locks to work they are draining the lake.  Of course it is refilled by the river, but each ship uses about 52 million gallons of water to traverse the locks.  The rainy season has not been very rainy this year so the lake level is down which means some ships can&rsquo;t go through, or they have to unload some cargo before they go.  One interesting addition that helps conserve water is that now we can use water from the side going down to halfway fill the side going up.  This is a nice bit of recycling that saves about 50% of the water.</p>

			 <p>After docking in Colon we joined our tour group for the day to see some of the sites in Panama.  This tour included stops at the new locks &ndash; Wide enough for the &ldquo;neo&rdquo; class ships that do not fit in the original canal.  It also included a stop and boat ride on Lake Gatun where we visited the village of some indigenous people and looked for wildlife along the shore.</p>
<p>I had this idea (probably from childhood) that the Panama canal was one long canal.  Which is not true at all.  The canal is actually a series of locks that bring the ship up into lake Gatun then you cross lake Gatun and go down some more locks to bring you back to the ocean.  So, the constraints on the ships are really the size of the locks.  In 2016 they opened a new set of locks at each end to support the really large ships.  Now the main constraint is really on the depth of the water in the lake.</p>
<p>Here is a view of both sets of locks on the Atlantic side:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The left side is the new lock which runs one way, They go one way for half the day and then the other way the other half of the day.  the right side is the old locks which run both ways most of the time, but they can shut it down and switch to one way traffic if they have maintenance to do.</p>
<p>Here is a view of the village we stopped at.</p>

<p>Number 11 we had to tee off in the trees and shoot over another tree to get on the green.</p>

<p>Number 15 the tractor was parked in front of the green.  Its hard enough to chip onto that hole without the obstacle.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>On the first hole we had to putt with a hockey stick!  Happy Gilmore!!It was hilarious nobody knew how hard to hit it with a stick.</p>

<p>Some of the other holes had hose or rakes or other obstructions laid out in front of the green.  Not to mention that the pin placements were diabolical!  Right on the edge of the green by the water, right on top of a hill.  A couple of the tee boxes were moved into the waste bunker areas near the tees.</p>

			 <p>This morning I got Wordle in 2!  Here is Proof:<br>
Wordle 564 2/6*<br>
⬜🟨🟨🟨🟨<br>
🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩</p>
<p>Since I won&rsquo;t post this until tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll tell you my first guess.  It was DELAY. I know there are better words but my personal practice on wordle is to sit and think about my day for a few minutes and then try to come up with a good starting word that is somehow related to those thoughts. Sort of a Wordle meditation.  I have rules, I&rsquo;m not going to use double letters, its not going to be super obscure, or use letters that are too rare. Although QUEST would not be out of the question.</p>
<p>Now you may be wondering why DELAY was my word today.  Well, it all started yesterday afternoon, in Minnesota, under a winter storm warning.  I could see traffic on the I-35W bridge over the Missippi was slow from the window in our condo, then I couldn&rsquo;t see the bridge at all.  Not good.  We were scheduled to fly back to Palm Springs at 6:07PM, so after some discussion we put on our backpacks at 2:40PM and headed for the light rail station near US Bank stadium, about 8 blocks or so.  The going was slow and we didn&rsquo;t know how the trains were doing but we were pretty sure it was a better option than Uber or Lyft.  We got to the station at 3:07 and had about 10 minutes to wait for the Blue Line toward the Mall of America.  Things were running much smoother than anticipated so we arrived at the airport <strong>way</strong> ahead of our typical 90 minutes before departure.  We knew we needed some extra time to grab an early bite to eat since dinner time would come somewhere over Denver.</p>
<p>About halfway into our dinner the Flighty app told me that our flight had just been delayed.  I was a little surprised because I had been following the progress of our plane and I knew it was already at the airport.  Must be a crew issue I thought.  So we stretched out our meal, watched the people for a while and then headed to our gate.  Sure enough we were waiting for a crew that was now &ldquo;flying around the weather.&rdquo; That sort of flying continued for some time as small delay after small delay started to add up.</p>
<p>Finally, a crew was located, and we started the boarding process.  After about 20 minutes on the plane we saw the captain and co-pilot arrive and they announced that there would be a bit more delay as they did their inspection and pre-flight paperwork.  Then there was more waiting until an announcement was made that the ground crews could not keep up with the freezing rain and they were closing the airport!  I&rsquo;ve never seen this happen in Minnesota!! We are hearty, we don&rsquo;t shut down our airports for mere rain and sleet and snow. That kind of behavior is reserved for wimpy east coast sorts. 🤪</p>
<p>It seems that as we were sitting on the plane another plane had slid off the end of the runway.  Ok, that might be a pretty good indicator that its time to close up shop for a while.  So we had to get off the plane again.  The gate agent assured us that the airport would open again around 10 or 10:30 PM and that we would be underway as soon as possible.   Ummm I wonder what that means?  You can&rsquo;t just shut down everything and then get 100&rsquo;s of delayed flights through de-icing and on the runway in a few minutes.</p>
<p>We decided to bag it.  Lets just get on the delta app and click on that nice little button that says reschedule.  It really is not that big of an inconvenience for us to wait another day or two to escape the cold and snow.  As I was talking to another passenger I said the hardest thing for me was that I had to cancel my tee time for tomorrow.  Yeah, first world problems I know.  Unfortunately the little button on the app didn&rsquo;t work.  Probably because we had already boarded&hellip; The app helpfully suggested an 800 number to call to straighten out the problem.  Unfortunately the sole purpose of the voice on the 800 number is to convince you that using delta.com or the app on your phone is really by far the better option than waiting on what was a very long hold queue due to extremely high call volume. Delta if you are listening this <em>is</em> an area for improvement in what I must admit is quite a good app under most circumstances.</p>
<p>I went up to ask the gate agent what we could do?  If we simply walk away now can we rebook later tonight? first thing tomorrow? Can you release us so that we can rebook ourselves? Instead she got on her terminal and rebooked us for this morning at 8:55.  Thanks helpful gate agent! I wish I had caught your name.  Next stop light rail station!</p>
<p>The path to the light rail station at MSP involves two fairly long escalators.  At the bottom of the first we were intercepted by transit police.  Crap, I thought they have closed the light rail and we are going to have to wait hours for a very expensive Uber in this weather.  Nope, just a short delay due to a suspicious object on the tracks. Maybe no more than 5 minutes, unless it really is a bomb.  Luckily the bomb dog was back up the escalator in no time apparently having no interest in said suspicious object.  To make a long story short we were home and ready for bed before they reopened the airport!</p>
<p>At 6:40 AM we begin to retrace our steps to the airport once again.  This morning the sidewalks are actually worse than they were 16 hours ago.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here we are on our way back to the light rail stations in the snow.</p>
<p>Back at the airport, we stop at the first kiosk we see to get new boarding passes which thankfully had our TSA PreCheck status on them! Then up to security.  Man am I glad we have PreCheck!  A stop at Caribou for some coffee and bagels and then down to the end of the G concourse.  Flighty and Delta agree we are still on time, but it is snowing like crazy.  We find some seats in the gate area and then realize that we are sitting next to someone we know! From Decorah Iowa!  She and her husband are on their way to spend a month in Palm Springs.  Chatting with them passes the time, and soon the agent announces pre-boarding &ndash; well it takes her a few tries as one of their mics makes them sound like the adults in the <em>Charlie Brown</em> TV shows &ndash; this is all looking too good to be true!</p>
<p>Soon enough we board but with all of the changes we have lost our nice aisle seats and are consigned to a middle and a window.  The window is moderately interesting as we can see that about six inches of snow have accumulated on the wing!  This is going to take some serious de-icing!  As we are trying to get to our seats the nice lady on the aisle asks us to be careful as her cat is in a carrier under the seat!  Hmmmm, I am extremely allergic to cats!  The allergist at mayo said I am the most cat allergic patient he&rsquo;s ever had.  We have a short conversation about that and she is very needlessly apologetic (she didn&rsquo;t know she would be seated next to me!). But she informs the flight attendant and they discuss an option of her moving across the aisle and up a row to a seat that hasn&rsquo;t filled yet in an effort to put more distance between me and the cat.  Although the flight is booked full it looks like there is definitely some room for maneuvering.</p>
<p>In an amazing stroke of luck, the flight attendant returns in a few minutes and asks if we would be willing to move back two rows and occupy exit row seats!  Well that would certainly improve my odds of not finishing the flight with itchy eyes and wheezy lungs!  And the nice cat lady gets a whole row to herself as a bonus.</p>
<p>After getting settled into our lovely exit row seats the pilot informs us there will be a short delay.  We are waiting for a couple of connecting passengers, so please everybody stay in the seats you were assigned&hellip; Ummm, but the flight attendant said it was OK to move.  A further delay was announced as the baggage carts are having a hard time getting around in the snow.  Yes, indeed when you see one of the giant pushback tugs towing the baggage carts you know there are some real problems with traction.</p>
<p>Finally the boarding doors are closed, and we breath a big sigh of relief. We are warned that the waiting is not over, and de-icing and takeoff is still a ways in our future.  In fact during the pushback process we apparently get stuck and we are rocked back and forth a few times before we finally get back far enough to fire up the engines.  De-icing does take a lot of time!  It turns out we had two coats, one to remove the ice and another to <a href="https://simpleflying.com/aircraft-deicing/">prevent more ice</a> which turns the wings an interesting color green.  That is to provide a visible signal of which parts of the wings have been treated and presumably will let them know when the chemicals are no longer doing their job, and reapplication is needed.  Anyway, after de-icing we get to watch a parade.  A parade of yellow vehicles plowing and brushing and throwing down all manner of chemicals on the runway to try to keep it safe for really large vehicles going hundreds of miles per hour that need to stop fast.  You can kinda-sorta see them in this picture out out window&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We are second in line for takeoff for at least 15 minutes!  I don&rsquo;t see any planes landing, I see an SUV driving down the runway with flashing lights. I&rsquo;m waiting for the announcement that we are going to have to return for more de-icing or even worse, return to our gate.  But then the engines fire up and we begin to taxi to take our turn!  As I look down the runway I realize that we are taking off blind! Visibility isn&rsquo;t even good enough to see the far end of the runway, maybe not even halfway&hellip; and then the pilot does one of those power takeoff maneuvers when he stands on the brakes and revs the jet engines to get more power, like we are on some kind of aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>Seconds later we are hurtling down the runway into the snow and fog then clouds; eventually we break through and see some blue sky and are on our way!  On our way to sunny Palm Springs, with no snow on the ground, and where our friends are surely complaining that it is <em>only</em> 64 degrees!</p>
<p>So long Minnesota&hellip; I&rsquo;m seriously re-thinking my quick visit back in February!  Will the grandkids hate me if we just FaceTime? Do I really need to go to Minneapolis to see the musical version of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird?</em> If I don&rsquo;t see Minnesota until April can anyone blame me?  Oh and the Wordle answer was LAYER, as in Ogers are like onions, as in always dress in. I&rsquo;m going to call that nothing but skill.</p>

<p>From our hike in the <strong>Zion Narrows</strong></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>From <strong>Antelope Canyon</strong>, I chose this because it was cool, and because our guide taught me some new tricks of iPhone photography!  Do you see the Bison?</p>

<p>From our early morning start in <strong>Grand Teton National Park</strong>.  I love the light in this one.</p>

			 <p>We arrived at our own private winter wonderland about 5:00 last night.  The lane to our cabin greeted us with a wonderful site.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The driveway, on the other hand, was not beautiful but a job waiting to be done.  I knew it was going to be bad because I had called to get the septic holding tank pumped out, and the driver called me back and asked when we were going to have the driveway plowed so he could get in.</p>
<p>We got the snowblower going and cleared the drive only to get another four inches of snow overnight.  It is truly beautiful around here and I was very thankful that the wind did not come up overnight and blow all the snow off the pine branches.</p>
<p>So, this morning after doing my PT exercises for my knee, I put on my boots and headed out the door with my phone to capture some of this.</p>
<p>Here are some of my favorites.  I like this one for the bends in the trees.  The snow is sure adding a lot of weight, but luckily I have not noticed any broken branches.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I always like to play with the macro feature of the iPhone.  This one really captured the crystals of the snow.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And finally one of our favorite places to hang out with the kids when there are with us. The fire pit!  I would love to have a fire going in there right now if only to add a spash of color.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And finally here is one of the heavily laden pins on the lake side of the house.  I love that tree on the left.  the landscaper wanted to pull it out 22 years ago, but I said no.  Lets let it grow.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After my walk we did another round of shoveling and snow blowing.  It looks like a guaranteed white Christmas this year, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to Kaia, Tanner, Josh, Rachel, Johannes and Maren joining us soon for Christmas.</p>

			 <p>Happy Thanksgiving!  What is your favored turkey cooking method?  I spatchcock it and put it on my kamado joe.  It <strong>retains</strong> all the moisture and comes out very juicy.  I&rsquo;ve dubbed this &ldquo;Yoga Turkey&rdquo;</p>

			 <h1 id="all-the-things-i-am-thankful-for">All the Things I am Thankful for</h1>
<p>I thought it would be fun to share a text and picture blog post of all of the things I am thankful for!  So here goes, the list is pretty long.</p>
<h2 id="my-grandkids">My Grandkids!</h2>
<p>Although I am still relatively new to the grandpa game, I love Hannes and Maren a ton!  If this isn&rsquo;t the coolest picture of a brand new big brother I really don&rsquo;t know what is.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="my-family">My family!</h2>
<p>This was taken before number 2 grandkid was conceived, at our lake house in wisconsin.  I think the comma after conceived is important&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="my-wife">My Wife</h2>
<p>My adventure partner, my companion, my <strong>everything!</strong>  I don&rsquo;t know who else would put up with me after all of these years.  COVID times may have curtailed our ability to see the rest of the world, but it definitely increased our desire to see the amazing country we live in.  Get yourself a camper and see the USA!  This particular picture was taken at Zion National Park. I could post hundreds of other selfies of us from the USA to Morocco to Istanbul to  Vietnam, to every other continent (except Antarctica)!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am thankful that wherever we are we are happy to be there.  We have the amazing fortune to have three homes.  I know, it&rsquo;s kind of embarassing, and soon enough we will not want to maintain three residences.</p>
<h3 id="indio-california">Indio, California</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="minneapolis-minnesota">Minneapolis, Minnesota</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="luck-wisconsin">Luck, Wisconsin</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>we built our cabin in Luck in 1999 as a place for our family to gather, and I&rsquo;m happy it has worked out as a place where we gather with our kids and grandkids when we are around.  I&rsquo;m also really happy that this is a place where our kids and their spouses and children gather without us when we are avoiding the cold and enjoying California.</p>
<h2 id="my-career">My Career</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m thankful that I love what I do, and that I control my own schedule.  How many people get to do what they love, and get paid for it?  How many can do it on their own time schedule?  I am the  main person behind Runestone Academy, and every day I am helping more than 60,000 students learn math and computer science.  But I can still play golf in the mornings with my friends, or ride bike, or play pickleball, or just have a cup of coffee and read the news or watch soccer or do the crossword puzzle.</p>
<h2 id="our-friends">Our Friends</h2>
<p>I am thankful for our friends!  Oh! I am so thankful for our friends!  I do not even want to start this!  But this guy and his wife are our oldest and dearest friends. College roommates, God parents to our kids, travel companions, you name it. This picture was taken on our 30th anniversary trip together. We take a trip every 5 years (sometimes every 4 AND 5 years) to celebrate our anniversaries.  I feel like this is such a wonderful and unique tradition.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I am sorry that I have not named everyone that is important to me. That list and post would be much longer.  I just started this post on a lark, and have only now realized the gravity of (not) naming everyone.  I hope you know who you are and how important you are to me.</p>
<p>The danger of a post like this is that ten minutes from now I will think of something or someone that I missed.  I am so sorry!</p>

			 <p>Instead of camping our way to California this Fall we decided to make it a four day drive. We stayed in, gasp, hotels! This is really our first driving trip where we have used hotels since the pandemic. The verdict? Its nice to pull your accommodations with you!</p>
<p>Our first night was a very nice lodge in Spearfish Canyon South Dakota. Although the lodge was nice it was kind of a bummer because we had a nice hike planned, but I had injured my foot just a couple of days before we took off and I couldn’t walk more than a few yards without a lot of pain.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/a15d6a3ba7.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We did see some pretty cool sheep on the hillside!</p>
<p>We left at O-dark-thirty on day two of our adventure and had the pleasure of scraping ice off our windshield for the first time in a very long time! Today’s drive would take us across Wyoming to a lodge just outside of Dutch John Utah. The area is better known as Flaming Gorge. It was very pretty but our lodge was quite remote and felt even more so because we were clearly in the after season. Only one restaurant in the area was open.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cc18333a50.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Even thought it was isolated, we had a very pretty view out the picture window of our cabin. Here is a nice Sunset shot!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/3a03c3058c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And to follow up, here is a sunrise photo from the same spot.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ef65214794.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>A long drive down I 15 brought us to Cedar City Utah for our third night. We headed up to Brian Head, a ski area and did a short little hike. My foot was feeling better by this time, but we still didn’t want to do too much. I love this shot of the show against the beautiful red rock! Our hotel was a Baymont tonight, and I’m not sure why, but the hotel had a some special “mini-rooms” even the door was about 3/4 of a normal width. This was our room for the night. The saving grace for the hotel was that it was near a brewery and a really excellent pizza place! I had a chicken pizza with white sauce and pistachios! Truly amazing.</p>

<p>Our last day was the final push to Indio. But we made a quick stop at Kolob Canyon to take a short hike. Maybe some of the most spectacular views yet.</p>

<p>This was a great way to do the trip out this year. We averaged about 6-7 hours of driving a day with time at the end of each day for a short hike or some site seeing.</p>

			 <p>Timing the fall colors is a tough game to play. It’s hard to predict when they will peak because there are so many factors at play. Jane did all of the research and tried to make a reservation for next week, but could not find a good campsite. So we reserved for this whole week thinking we would use part of our reservation. Then I found out I had other commitments at the end of the week so we had to push our time further forward.</p>
<p>The results speak for themselves.</p>
<p>We arrived on a very gloomy and rainy Sunday afternoon. But discovered our campsite was just 100 hundred yards or less from the shore.</p>

<p>The next day was cool and clear so we did the 7.5 mile bean and bear hike near silver bay. The colors we almost there but not quite. Still it was a very beautiful hike, although Jane lost her Yellowstone hat from the vantage point where we took this photo.</p>

<p>A shorter hike on another clear day, but further north near Lutson had amazingly vibrant fall colors.</p>

			 <p>After a couple of years of taking long camping trips during the month of October it has been wonderful to be at the cabin for the “Fall colors” this year. These pics just highlight the everyday beauty of the area during October.</p>
<p>Its a bit cold to bike (40 degrees) but it is a nice temperature to walk. Here are a few photos that Jane and I have taken in the last two days on our walks around the cabin. Enjoy!</p>

			 <p>The road home runs through Devils Tower National Monument. A monument who got its name from a misunderstanding between the Native Americans name “Bear Lodge” and the white people.</p>
<p>Nothing about this tower says evil/devil. But apparently after the army slaughtered all of the bison the area was a stinking pile of carcasses and the army colonel described it as Devil’s Tower. There is a movement to change it back, predictably opposed by Wyoming members of congress. You can read more about it on the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/devils-tower-name-genesis.htm">park service website</a></p>
<p>As is our usual practice we spent the last night on the road at a KOA so we could have a nice easy way to clean out our tanks for the long trip home. This KOA shows a movie every night — Close Encounters of the Third Kind. You may remember that this monument featured in that movie.</p>

<p>The title picture for this post was taken at 6 AM as we pulled out of the park to being our 13 hour journey back to Wisconsin. This was a fantastic trip, made even better by our traveling companions. Where will we be five years from now? Who knows, but it will be an adventure.</p>

			 <p>Although there was a huge flood in Yellowstone just over a month ago there was very little of the park that was closed to visitors. We took full advantage of that and saw everything that the park had to offer. When most people think of Yellowstone, they probably think of Old Faithful, but there is so much more to the park than that. We did a few longer hikes, and a lot of short hikes. We saw beautiful rivers and waterfalls and canyons. Even the meadows along the river were amazingly beautiful. I am very grateful to the Hayden expedition, congress, and to President Grant for making Yellowstone the first national park in the world.</p>
<p>The grand canyon of Yellowstone was really grand, and maybe my favorite of the trip. There are two huge waterfalls, upper and lower. Here is a view of the lower falls — which are 308 feet tall! For comparison Niagara is 167 feet but Iguazu falls are 360. I looked it up so you get to read it!</p>
<p>We started out our visit to the grand canyon of Yellowstone at artist point, supposedly named for some paintings made by the artist Thomas Moran who was part of the Hayden expedition. Moran painted the falls to present to congress because after discovering Yellowstone they knew that it needed to be preserved and wanted to persuade congress to preserve this place for future generations.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.yellowstonepark.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ys-thomas-moran-gr-canyon-smithsonian_wikipd_680x392.jpg?width=680" alt="Thomas Moran&rsquo;s painting of the lower falls"></p>
<p>But this is a mistake, he actually made the paintings from the north rim. Nevertheless its a great view point and you could definitely be inspired to paint there.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/863ae66793.png" alt="Upper Falls"></p>
<p>From the north side of the canyon You can take a 3/4 mile hike down to the brink of the upper falls. Its a 600 foot elevation change but you get to stand and look right over the falls.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/399a7afa2c.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Sometimes you can happen upon something really nice just by taking a short little offshoot of the main road. These are wonderful stops without the crowds that you see at some of the main attractions.</p>

<p>This has been a wonderful trip. Tomorrow we leave Yellowstone and begin the two day trek back home. We will make a stop at Devils Tower tomorrow night, and then have a marathon day back to the cabin in Wisconsin on Friday.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Educational Post Alert (EPA)! Did you know there are four kinds of geothermal features in Yellowstone? And that Yellowstone has more than half of the worlds geysers ? Thats geysers not geezers , although there are a lot of geezers here, I’m pretty sure its not more than half of the worlds population.</p>
<p>The first couple of days in the park we visited a lot of thermal features I’m going to take them by feature rather than going in order. We will go from most boring to least boring. As a bonus for sticking with us you will get to see wildlife photos.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with Fumaroles. You might think these sound like some nice Italian pastry stuffed with sweet cream filling, but you would be wrong. Fumaroles are gas vents. And when I say gas I mean sulfur gas. You can encounter these things all over the park and you usually see them and hear them before you actually get to them.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e00a976084.png" alt="Dragon&rsquo;s Breath"></p>
<p>Next on the list are the mud pots. Mud pots are boiling pools of, well, mud. In the springtime when there is more runoff and rain they tend to be kind of thin, but by late summer and early fall they are very thick and muddy. These are also quite odiferous, but kind of fun to watch them bubble away and spew mud into the air.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/01af2add0d.png" alt="Mudpot"></p>
<p>Third are the thermal pools. These can be quite beautiful actually. They look like they would be wonderful to sit in like a hot tub. But they are actually way too hot for that and their PH is quite acidic. They also contain lots of interesting kinds of bacteria that only grow at higher temperatures. In fact the colors in these pools are from mats of bacteria that thrive at different temperature levels. Not only are they pretty, but they are scientifically useful in that they help make DNA replication much faster!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/685f68b150.png" alt="Morning Glory Pool"></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/af0eb60a97.png" alt="Mammoth Hot Springs"></p>
<p>This pool deserves some special mention. It is right in Lake Yellowstone. It gives anglers the option to catch their fish and cook it without even taking it off the hook. It is called the fishing cone.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/aec7859df8.png" alt="Fishing Cone"></p>
<p>Finally, the most famous and dramatic of all of the features are the Geysers. Geysers are especially fun when they erupt. Old faithful, here at Yellowstone erupts every 35 minutes to 2 hours. We enjoyed seeing old faithful twice, once from a viewpoint up on the hill quite a ways away, and the other time right up close. We also witnessed several other smaller eruptions and different geysers around the park.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/13e9eac6b1.png" alt="Old Faithful Overlook"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/85a51fabcc.png" alt="Old Faithful Selfie"></p>
<p>OK, you made it this far, here are some animals. By far the animal we have seen the most is the Bison. We have seen them in the field, near the road, on the road, rolling in the dirt, everywhere. We did not pet them. We also saw this nice herd of Elk in the distance. But no bears. We did get to observe some black wolves, but trust me they are so far in the distance that they don’t really make for sharable photos. We also saw a coyote out on the road in the middle of the day, which is quite unusual.</p>

			 <p>The first ferry across Jenny lake leaves at 7am she said. We decided to shoot for the 7:30 crossing, which turned out to be a brilliant move. First we avoided lots of crowds, and second, we were up into Cascade Canyon in time to see a group of bull moose waking up!</p>
<p>One of the nicest hikes in Grand Teton is the Hidden Falls, Inspiration point, and Cascade Canyon combination. It is about a 480 foot climb for the first mile and then it evens out for the walk through the beautiful glacial canyon. By leaving early we avoided the people coming down the trail as we were heading up and it was generally a lot more peaceful.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/207748ce4a.png" alt="Jenny Lake Ferry Ride"></p>
<p>The first stop was hidden falls, a beautiful waterfall on cascade creek that feeds into Jenny lake. The lake temperature is 60 degrees at the surface, “but gets a little more chilly if you dive down.” Not much chance of that happening.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e010e9c646.png" alt="Hidden Falls"></p>
<p>A further climb leads you to inspiration point. On the way up this climb there are a couple of places to stop and take in some of the peaks in the Teton range. Including this picture of Teewanot. The contrast of the morning sun against the storm clouds over the peak was awe inspiring already. And yes we did hear thunder, but thankfully we did not see or experience any lightning!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4b230b6b21.png" alt="Teewanot - sounds like astronaut"></p>
<p>When you arrive at Inspiration point you have a fantastic view of the lake. I love this shot that shows the ferry leaving the dock leaving a feather-like wake.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/de26911fa7.png" alt="Jenny Lake"></p>
<p>After inspiration point the trail levels out some, and so we were just enjoying a nice walk back into the Cascade Canyon. We caught a few raindrops as the storm clouds passed over us, but not enough to get wet. We happened to talk with a couple of guys coming down the trail who told us they had just seen a couple of moose laying in a meadow about 5-10 minutes up the trail. We were lucky enough to spot them when we arrived! It was a bit disappointing to see nothing but antlers, but It looked like they were beginning to stir so we decided to hangout a while and see if anything happened. During the wait we amassed a huge collection of very bad photos of moose antlers behind plants in the deep shade.</p>
<p>But sure enough after a 15 minute wait one of them stood up. This caused a second one to rouse itself as well. Eventually they ventured into some light bright enough to get a few decent photos. Although 99% of our photos are taken on iPhones these days we were glad to have brought along our old Sony A6000 with the telephoto lens to get a better closeup.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/3bf3b9b6da.png" alt="Thats Mr. Moose to you."></p>
<p>This little encounter reminded us how lucky you are to see wildlife while hiking along. The animals are so hard to spot if they are not up and moving. We often wondered how often we passed some kind of wildlife that was just quietly lying behind a bush a few feet away.</p>
<p>We continued further into the canyon now in hopes of seeing a bear (at a very safe distance). The closest we came to a bear was a surly teenager who ruined his grandma’s entire day with his behavior. A side note here - it seems that leaving early is a good strategy because it is mostly people our age on the trail and some families with younger happy children or cute babies in backpacks who get up early in the morning. We noticed a lot more teens on the trip down in late morning.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5718d44110.png" alt="Cascade Canyon"></p>
<p>We arrived back at camp in time to make some lunch. I guess I really worked up an appetite because caesar salad with chicken never tasted so good. We voted for a lazy afternoon of reading, and checking out the beach. Around 4:00 we took a short drive up Signal Mountain to take in the views of the “hole.” Fun fact: The term hole was a common term to describe a high altitude valley. Further fun fact - the term “dude ranch” specifically the term dude was a pejorative term in the late 1800’s to refer to a city dweller who needed to be pampered and was very likely unable to look after themselves in the wilderness.</p>

			 <p>What do Oxbow bend, Schwabacher landing, the Moulton barn and the snake river overlook all have in common? These are all iconic sites to see in the park. We set out early again this morning to beat the crowds and the heat to see them all. Although today was not a day for long hikes we did enjoy several short walks to see the sites.</p>
<p>The first stop was an early morning stop at Oxbow bend. A great place to spot wildlife, but even though we were there early in the morning we didn’t see any mammals. The coolest thing we saw at Oxbow was an Osprey carrying off a trout to its nest. A trout is perfectly streamlined for flight underneath a bird of prey.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e142fa5419.png" alt=""></p>
<p>A little further down the road we had a fantastic view of Grand Teton in the beautiful morning light.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/b3c017df5a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Our next stop was at the Snake River overlook. This is the place where Ansel Adams took his iconic photo that put Grand Teton on the map. There are more trees now than when he took the photo in 1942. We did our best to recreate the photo using 2020 technology and filters.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/0687b49683.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/247afba160.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As we were heading to the truck we overheard one young dad tell his three kids “Look kids there are some iconic Grand Teton crows”. The only thing I can imagine that would inspire a statement like that was if they too had been listening to Gypsy Guide in the car.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/d4118d7def.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Further on down the road we went, this time our stop was Schwabacher landing. We were in luck! There was a mama moose and her baby eating and drinking in the river. This time I had our good old Canon SLR with the long lens so we were able to get some really good photos of the pair.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c0e7a01b09.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/712b692434.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once again we were really hoping to see a bear so we spent more time at a little more secluded pullout at Schwabacher but didn’t see anything but more birds.</p>
<p>The last of our iconic stops was on mormon row where there are some well preserved barns from the 1890s.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4a0485a1c6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After seeing all of these iconic sites we decided to continue on into Jackson and wander around the town a bit. It was a Saturday so we happened to hit the farmers market for some great fresh bread. Other than that Jackson seemed pretty much like every other western tourist town.</p>

			 <p>The morning dawned crisp and clear, it was great to sleep with the windows open taking in the cool clean air. I made my coffee, and thanks to our range extender I was even able to read the news and extend my 73 day streak on Wordle. I had just finished wordle when I heard Brian lighting the campfire outside. The plan for the day was to start with a hearty breakfast and then head out to do the Cathedral Spires and Little Devils Tower hike. After hiking we will do the black hills loop drive, including Iron Mountain highway and the Needles highway.</p>
<p>We began with an egg bake cooked over an open fire. Delicious and the hashed browns on the bottom of the pan were wonderfully crispy.</p>
<p>The Cathedral Spires hike was wonderful, but Little Devils Tower was spectacular! The Cathedral Spires were the inspiration for Mount Rushmore. The hike up there was fine but when you finally get into the spires themselves you can see how inspirational they really are.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/68e6320b50.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/63aef4d21a.png" alt="Headed up the Cathedral Spires"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/917e61cd40.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We arrived at a clearing with a nice shady area to sit, but there were also trails leading off in a couple of different directions. Brian and I were convinced there must be more so we explored a bit only to realize that there was not much more to see. When we got back Jane and Holly pointed to the sign below.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f0c1f5747e.png" alt="Self explanatory"></p>
<p>OK, so we were undisputedly at the end of the trail.</p>
<p>Just a short distance back down the trail was the turn off to head to Little Devils Tower. This was largely a climb and we were not sure where it was going to end, spoiler alert its up on top of these rocks.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4c84d9e396.png" alt="Little Devils Tower"></p>
<p>The trail was full of little chips of Mica and in some places it was so fine that the very fine sand looked muddy! We also walked through a whole section of trail full of “fools gold.” Both Holly and Jane were sporting knee braces so we were trying to take care, and in fact one elderly lady we met on the trail referred to them as “brave”. We laughed about that for a long time. Unfortunately when we got about a quarter mile from the payoff to this part of the hike it was clear that those with knee braces were not going to go rock climbing on all fours.</p>
<p>That left Brian and I to make our way to the summit on our own. It was definitely a good bit of rock scrabbling. But the view from the top was well worth the effort. Just imagine standing on top of that little dome of rock. Nothing to block your view for 360 degrees.</p>
<p>Here is Brian making his way up one of the easier parts of the final push.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4c7424805a.png" alt="Brian making the final push"></p>
<p>And here is the best I can do from the top. Pictures do not even come close to capturing what we saw.</p>

<p>On the way down we had one very funny moment when Brian’s water bottle slipped out of his back pack and went clattering down the granite. We thought for sure the women would hear it and think one of us had fallen down the hill. Just a little bit of extra character for the bottle.</p>
<p>The rest of the day we were in the car, enjoying the Needles Highway. There are three tunnels carved through the granite, but they are only 8 feet 9 inches wide and just over 10 feet tall. This is why we had to take the long way around to our campground! No way is the camper going to fit through this tunnel!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/72589399d4.png" alt="Through one of the eyes of the needle"></p>
<p>The Iron Mountain highway with its pigtail bridges and views of Mount Rushmore is also a great part of the drive. We didn’t see any bison or other wildlife. But we enjoyed the drive and the views.</p>
<p>At one point near the end we got enough service for some emails to arrive. Luckily I looked long enough to see an urgent email regarding one of our grant proposals that was due in just an hour or so. Apparently our part needed to be submitted. So I tried to log in on my phone and navigate the NSF website to submit our grant. Now the NSF site is a big pile of crap from the 90’s that is hard to navigate on the best of days with a desktop browser. Trying to navigate it in a half-panic on your phone is horrible. Let’s just say there is nothing responsive about the design and the design did nothing to anticipate the use of mobile devices. In the end I gave up and sent my password to the grant officer at Michigan, who ended up having to call NSF tech support because indeed the submit button was not where it should have been. It turns out that being an administrator and Principle Investigator is not enough to submit a proposal, I needed to have a new role as Authorized Organizational Representative. Of course the site itself does not say that. Dear NSF better error messages would help…</p>
<p>Dinner for the evening was our celebratory anniversary meal. Steak over the fire — someone left the sous vide in California! — baked potatoes, salad and a couple of bottles of really nice wine we brought for the occasion.</p>

			 <p>Today (Day 2) was a day of driving across South Dakota. What do you see when driving across South Dakota? Billboards, lots and lots of billboards. Wall Drug, of course. But lots of others too, apparently the Firehouse Brewery is trying to be the new Wall Drug. They have signs and bright red fire trucks every few miles. Here are a few of our favorite slogans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mexican food so good that Donald Trump would build a wall around it!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t even remember if the name of the restaurant was mentioned. But I would love to eat there to support the owners.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is wisdom in wine.</p>
<p>There is bacteria in water</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Love it, let’s have a glass of wine to celebrate the author of that sign.</p>
<p>I have to say that South Dakota is not a good value; it is pretty expensive scenery at almost $1.00 per mile! The reason that today was particularly expensive was the headwind. We were driving straight into a 20 mph wind gusting to 40 mph at times. Our gas mileage is normally 9-10 mph while pulling our camper, but today we were averaging 5.3. Yikes! I was beginning to think that today was our day for mechanical troubles until we stopped to fill up. I could hardly push the door open against the wind. Although relieved to understand why we were getting such poor mileage, Knutson’s van performed perfectly and with a diesel engine they were only using about a quarter of a tank to our 25 gallon fills.</p>
<p>We made it to the Badlands in the late morning and took the scenic drive through. The last time I was on this road, I was on my bike, so it was a different experience to see it from the truck.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1a0233e2f9.png" alt="The gang in the Badlands"></p>
<p>The Badlands are so interesting with millions of years of geologic history on display. They have a map that shows what things looked like all those years ago and clearly this part of the world was under water.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/555b53a1ed.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After we got through the Badlands our final 100 miles for the day brought us to Custer State Park. I think it must be one of the most beautiful state parks in the country. Our camp sight was beautiful, if a little small to back into. We set up camp at the Sylvan Lake campground and after a round of beers in the shade we headed out for the short hike around the lake.</p>

<p>Dinner was wonderful, we had some delicious french dip foil sandwiches. Holly had made them with cheese and roast beef and then wrapped them in foil, we put them over the fire and they came out perfectly. Meanwhile we took on the task of trying to figure out the problem with the gas supply to the grill and griddle. By process of elimination we determined that it was the quick connect coupler on the camper that had to be clogged. The protective cover had either come off or we had forgotten to put it on, so it wasn’t too surprising that road grime was interfering with the flow. We took it off and washed it good with soapy water. That cleared it all up and so we are back in business to cook with gas. However we are having fun improvising our cooking over the open camp fire.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly holly and Brian had not slept very well their first night in their van, so we called it a night relatively early.</p>

<p>Every five-ish years we have a special trip with our good friends Brian and Holly. We were all married on the same weekend in June, but one year apart. Brian was my college roommate and my best man. So to celebrate our five year anniversaries we do a trip together. We have been to Door County, Hawaii, the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, you get the idea. Every time we go it is an adventure.</p>
<p>This year is our 36th anniversary and their 35th. A few years ago we rented a 32 foot RV and visited Banff and Glacier. This year, we decided to keep the national park theme going and are heading to the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone. Since we have a travel trailer, Brian and Holly decided to rent a camper van and we would drive and camp together.</p>
<p>We were about an hour down the road when we got the following text from Holly.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/16e944b41e.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So we pulled off in Saint James and parked behind the Caseys. After turning off the van and restarting the engine everything seemed fine. So we continued on down the road. We got all the way to Heron Lake when it happened again. So we pulled into the Conoco station and they called their rental company. Once again restarting the van fixed the problem. After the third time we decided to pull over in Worthington and get some help from the rental company. The first thing we learned was that the roadside assistance provided with the rental was completely useless. They said they found one place that could help us, in the little town of Lismore, that could get us in on Wednesday! Discussions ensued with the owner of the RV who seemed pretty knowledgeable and correctly diagnosed what the problem was. Meanwhile the rental company got busy trying to locate an alternative RV to bring to us. The RV was in “limp mode”. When the RPMs exceed 2700 the turbo is not able to keep up and goes into a mode where you cannot accelerate.</p>
<p>At the owners suggestion we continued toward Sioux Falls, with a stop for gas in Luverne where gas was just $4.09. While we were in town we made a quick stop at Papik motors where we were able to get the error code read, which confirmed the diagnosis. A little further down the road we got word that we should head to Chris’s Auto Repair in Sioux Falls. If you ever need some work done on your car in Sioux Falls I would highly recommend, they are the nicest group you will find. They did some more diagnostic work to figure out exactly what needed to be replaced. Unfortunately they couldn’t get the part until Wednesday, so the owner dispatched his mechanic to make the four hour drive to Sioux Falls with the part. We now knew that we were not going camp in the badlands, so we found a couple of sites at the very nice Lake Vermillion recreation area.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1cd2f18d20.png" alt=""></p>
<p>While waiting for the mechanic, we had happy hour and made some burgers. We were planning on grilling, but for some reason could not get the grill to light! Another mystery to figure out when we get settled in Custer. The induction burner and frying pan worked out just fine, so we had our burgers and enjoyed the views of the lake.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f5fa025855.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At around 9:00 the mechanic arrived, well it was actually not the mechanic but someone’s teenage son. Whatever! He got the job done and the RV has been running like a champ all day today.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Unfortunately our lottery attempts were a bust and neither of us got selected. So we did the next best thing and hiked Wire Pass. Getting to Wire Pass is about half the adventure as it is 7.9 miles off the highway on a very bumpy dirt and gravel road. Jane loves driving the truck in these off-road conditions, I just grit my teeth until we are there.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/0719fb3633.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It turns out that the trailhead for Wire Canyon is also the trailhead for the Wave (also known as North Coyote Canyon.) We thought about just following the trail to the wave, but decided that if there were rangers checking passes that it probably was not worth it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/92cbf6387c.png" alt=""></p>
<p>In the end Wire Canyon was great, lots of slot canyons to walk through and just a huge wall at the end. Not only the wall, but there are ancient Petroglyphs carved into the wall.</p>

<p>After eating out every night so far on this little camping trip we finally made dinner at the camper. Jerry found enough left over firewood to make a little fire and we cooked our curried pork satays over an open flame.</p>

<p>Houseboat by sheer cliffs</p>
<p>private beach with no neighbors</p>
<p>billions of bright stars</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After piloting a 50 foot houseboat for an afternoon, I think I’m ready to give cruise ships a try! It’s probably not that much different…</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/a9fea52bff.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We arrived at the rental office and looked down, down, down the hill past where the water levels have been for decades down to the lowest point since the 1960’s. At the various marinas the self serve boat landings end 50 feet above the water level! That is gonna be a long way to schlep all this stuff was the common sentiment among our group.</p>
<p>Luckily the checkin process went much better than we were expecting, and after our orientation on the boat our person had a gator with two wagons attached to ride up the hill and fetch all of our stuff! The houseboat itself is a wonder, and much nicer than we were anticipating! There are lots of little details to remember about running the generator to charge the batteries, what things run on AC power and what things run on batteries with the inverter. For the most part you don’t really have to worry too much. We have just started the generator at the times we want to cook and while we are cooking the batteries get recharged. Plus there is a nice gas grill on the top deck for cooking as well.</p>
<p>Once we had everything stowed we were ready to get under way. They give you surprisingly little training for driving a giant boat, but one of the guides kindly accompanied us out of the harbor, watch over my shoulder and sharing a few tips for steering. The bottom line is that you don’t turn a houseboat on a dime, you need to anticipate and not oversteer.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/483525918f.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Next stop was the Wahweap Marina, below the lodge, for some reason the kayak rental place we used cannot deliver to the boat rental place. So I already had to figure out how to go and dock this big thing. The pilot helping me out seemed very skeptical about the whole idea. “Maybe they can just bring the kayaks to you in a boat?” Despite his lack of faith I did find a place to dock and we got the Kayaks loaded and headed on our way. The general consensus was that Navajo Canyon was our best bet for finding a place to beach the houseboat. So off we went!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/84a6b86b6e.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Part of the way back into Navajo canyon we found a magnificent spot! It was clearly a spot recently used as the holes for the anchors were already dug in all the right spots for us. So yay! That saved us a bunch of work. We may stay here until we have to leave on Sunday. We are truly disconnected here, no cell service at all, no WiFi or anything. Hopefully all is well in the world!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e301640e2f.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Ann and Jane did a little exploring in some nearby coves!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c87cd49835.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After a dinner of Peruvian Chicken we taught Ann and Jerry to play a new game. Before retiring for the night we all went on the top deck and lay face up on the mats — STARS — a clear sky and no light pollution makes for a spectacular view.</p>

<p>Today was mostly just getting from Zion over to Page Arizona. We had to take the camper through the tunnel, which was interesting because they make the tunnel one way traffic whenever there is a camper or bus that needs to go through. The road is just a little too narrow for comfort and although two campers could probably pass each other many mirrors would be broken. From there we went through Kanab and then onward toward Page Arizona.</p>
<p>About 20 miles outside of Kanab we came to a sudden stop. There was a huge lineup of cars on our side of the road and no oncoming traffic except for the few cars we could see turning around. With no cell service it was a total mystery as to what had transpired ahead. We assumed it was an accident of some kind. But how long would we have to wait? After sitting some time the paramedics from Kanab came by heading toward the accident, so we knew it would be quite a while. Jerry and I decided to take a little hike up the road to see if we could find any information or even just to see if we could see the start of the backup. After walking about a mile we started chatting with another person who said that there had been a lot of smoke and the word was that a camper had tipped over and caught fire. Rescue crews were looking for volunteer vehicles to help clear the road. But nobody knew how long it would be before we could get underway.</p>
<p>We met people with timed reservations at Antelope canyon, and others on their way to Lake Powell every car on our walk back wanted to know if we had learned anything. We we tried to tell what we knew in ever decreasing detail. A few minutes after getting back to the car we could see the front of the line start to move. It was just about 1 hour delay. Luckily we were not on any time schedule. We could clearly see the problem when we got to the front! We hope everyone survived! This really made us think about the dangers of driving in remote areas, no cell service in this area? We can only imagine how long that RV burned before word got to the authorities and someone was able to respond 20 miles from the nearest town!</p>
<p>The other unfortunate thing about the day was that the wind was just howling 20 mph with gusts of much more. At our campsite we could hardly close our door with both hands! Needless to say we were not going to sit around in the camper in the wind, so we headed down to see horseshoe bend. It takes a bit to walk down to the viewpoint and on the way there we had convinced ourselves that the wind was letting up a bit. But when we got to the edge of the canyon overlooking the bend we were sand blasted! You could hardly stand it with the bits of sand and gravel whipping around and stinging your skin.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1af3fe0e7a.png" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/904a3b69ea.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So maybe outdoor hiking is not a good idea today either. Maybe we should go into page to the brewery and distillery? That turned out to be a great call. Good beer, decent pizza and some really nice gin — made with botanicals. Yes, I am on vacation I had gin and beer.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/87269a4521.png" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/76ae1cf30b.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Back at the camper the wind had calmed down so we settled in for a rousing game of “Mexican Train” dominoes. It was a game full of twists and turns, just when we thought we had it figured out Jane staged a dramatic last minute victory.</p>

<p>Suddenly floating</p>
<p>Down the river goes my wife</p>
<p>Someone grab her hat!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/693a31bedc.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It was a beautiful morning in Zion National Park, we were up early to get to the outfitters to rent our waders/dry suits for the hike in the Zion Narrows. This is a hike we have wanted to do since 2009 when we brought the kids with us to Zion. It was worth the wait and is definitely in my top 10 list of hikes.</p>
<p>The water temperature was 56 degrees and the river was flowing at 46 cubic feet per minute. So it was not too high, but it was rapid enough that a lot of the time we really needed our poles to stabilize ourselves. I was under the impression that the entire hike was in the river. Thank God it was not. A lot of the hike involves zig zagging back and forth to get to dry land to walk on a trail for a short distance before going to the other side to do the same.</p>
<p>I felt like an explorer as you could not see very far ahead, so at every turn there was another turn just up ahead and you never knew what was coming up next.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/210aab74b6.png" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7c6165b474.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Our goal was to make it to the split and then walk a little further upstream to “Wall Street” where things get even more narrow. Which we did, we also explored a path to a waterfall. But that was not too productive, as there was a mini waterfall and boulder in our way. So we headed back.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the deepest crossing that also had a very strong current that was when things went awry. I was walking just ahead of Jane when I saw her start to float by! She had stumbled and done a slow fall into the deeper water. I was able to grab on to her and get her upright but not before a bunch of very cold water had gone over the top of her dry suit bibs! Her hat started to float downstream but luckily some nice young person was there to stop it. When we got out of the water on the other bank we looked back to find that Ann had stumbled in the water as well.</p>
<p>The dry suit did an excellent job of keeping out the water for most of the trip, and now it was doing an equally good job of keeping the water in! Which meant that every time jane got into a little deeper water the pressure on the suit forced the cold water inside the suit to squeeze up! Not comfortable. At this point our hike became a march to get back to the trailhead as quickly as we could to get the women out of their wet clothes. Unfortunately Ann fell one more time in the water and then took a tumble on some rocks on the land and bruised her elbow and banged up her knee.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8ccfc1e857.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Despite it all we still enjoyed some awesome scenery along the way. When we arrived at the trailhead it was quite a process to remove all of our wet gear. I pulled open the cuff on Jane’s dry suit and a gallon of water came pouring out. We still had a one mile hike to get back to the busses which was just about enough time for their wet clothes to dry out.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/b3d2fb58d2.png" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1b579e4be3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We were all amazed and surprised at the casual nature of the outfitters in town. Here is some stuff, try it on and let me know if you need a different size. Signing the waiver of liability was totally on the honor system, and paying seemed to be an honor system thing as well. How they knew what we had taken or paid for, or even returned is a mystery. I guess a dry suit is not something you are likely to steal, but it felt nice and refreshing to not have to sign and number and carefully check in and out each piece of gear!</p>
<p>This is a hike we would definitely repeat with our family if we ever get back here again.</p>
<p>We arrived safely back at our campsite where we packed up some drinks and our swimsuits and headed to the east side of the park. We needed to get inside the geofence area to get in the daily lottery for a chance to hike the Wave. They only allow 64 people a day into the Wave so it takes some luck. After driving even further than we wanted to we finally got enough cell signal to enter. It was kind of funny with four of us and four different generations of iPhones each with different signal strength trying to get the recreation.gov app to work with only a single bar of LTE signal!</p>
<p>After finally succeeding in getting two of us in the lottery we gave up and headed over to Ann and Jerry’s hotel to use the hot tub! That felt great. Jerry offered to buy us all dinner if we could go to a sports bar where he could attempt to turn us into Phoenix Suns fans.</p>

			 <p>After some city time we were excited to get back to nature. Its hard to believe that we only have six days left before we arrive in Indio. Living in the camper has somehow become our “new normal”.</p>
<p>We are back in desert country so our campsite didn’t have many trees, but it did have a great view of the sky and the horizon. We did a pretty long hike along the canyon rim where we were able to see the Rio Grande river and look across into Mexico. The hike was just over seven and a half miles so our feet were tired by the time we got back from this hot dusty walk.</p>

<p>Since this was our last opportunity to have a campfire and cook over an open flame we made the most of it and enjoyed some time under the stars. I played around with my new phone features and got a couple of nice nighttime shots.</p>

			 <p>I was looking down at my phone or something inside the car when we made the transition. I looked up and saw this sight!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/b75bc52b20.png" alt="Plowed Roads!"></p>
<p>It looked like we had suddenly been transported to Wisconsin in the middle of January! Instead we were at White Sands National Monument in New Mexico. Not far from the Missile Range and the test site for the Manhattan Project.</p>
<p>We did some messing around on the dunes, enjoying the beautiful contrast between the white sand and the clear blue sky!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ea112b4896.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/b5d5bbd348.png" alt=""></p>
<p>From White Sands we went back to our campsite at Leasburg Dam and hooked up to head further west. We had opted for a KOA in Wilcox AZ for the night so we could have all our tanks clean and empty for the final drive to Indio.</p>
<p>Little did we know that Wilcox is some kind of wine Mecca for the state of Arizona. Who ever heard of an Arizona wine anyway? We had to give them a try so after making camp and doing a little work with the good WiFi. We headed to the Coronado Winery to test a few wines and enjoy some of their food. The wine was actually really good, I ended up buying a bottle of their Rose to take with me and Jane bought a bottle of the Sangiovese.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/feb4ba5c4d.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Its been an incredible trip and all we have left is about six hours of driving on I-10 tomorrow! Depending on how early we get on the road we will be in Indio by early to mid-afternoon. Lots to look forward to there, and looking forward to reconnecting with all of our Indio friends, golfing partners and pickleball players!</p>

			 <p>After a beautiful night at Seminole Canyon, we were on our way to Big Bend National Park. This is a good time to see this park as Big Bend is definitely not on the way to anywhere. The park is huge, and very remote. It borders the Rio Grande and has some spectacular hiking.</p>
<p>Getting into our “pull through” site was our first adventure. It was on the wrong side of the road for our camper so first we had to drive down the road the wrong way. The site is on a hill and half of the site is very sloped so we had to pull up to the level area and leave the pickup blocking the road until we were leveled and unhooked. Thankfully the rangers around here are very friendly and understanding. One even told us that he would block traffic for us when we left if he was around to make it easy for us to go the wrong way. I love a friendly rule breaker!</p>
<p>After some sandwiches for lunch I worked a bit and read with the idea that we would do the hike to the Window sometime after 4:00. This turned out to be a great decision as we ended up in shade for most of the hike and on the way back we had just beautiful light on the mountains. This hike was downhill from the start and uphill all the way back!</p>
<p>This was the end of the hike where we could see the plains below the window from our valley!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5c9dd62faa.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e5a7c4ba64.png" alt=""></p>
<p>On the way back we had several opportunities to enjoy the beautiful lighting! This one is my favorite, I really love the reflection of the mountains beyond in this tiny pool.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2c5f86c29c.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I also loved the contrast in the lighting, from the shadow we were walking in to the canyon walls still in bright, late afternoon sunlight!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6b69a04fe7.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cca8863999.png" alt=""></p>
<p>We didn’t get back from the hike until after 7:00 so after a drink and a bit of rest it was dark by the time I started the griddle for supper. We had decided on fried burgers. I haven’t made a burger on a flat top in forever, but let me tell you, it was great! Nicely browned on the outside and we toasted some buttered buns right next to the burgers! It took me right back to my childhood having burgers at the Cafe in Storden Minnesota with my grandma Sundahl.</p>
<p>This morning we were up and waiting for the sun to clear the canyon wall so we could position the solar panels for the day before we took off on our sightseeing tour. It was great.</p>
<p>We followed the Ross Maxwell road (an early park super) and it was beautiful! The highlight of the trip was the view of “the notch” No! not the one on the iPhone or the new macbook pro, but a gigantic notch between the mountains carved out by the Rio Grande! This was our first view of it from about 10 miles away!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4157e62878.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f686df28b4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When we got closer it was great to get out and walk into the canyon. The drought is so bad that the Rio Grande is very low .</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/81c569a020.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So low, in fact, that we were definitely in Mexico for a few minutes!</p>

			 <p>We pulled out of the campground in the dark. The first time I can remember us breaking camp in the dark. It was not that early it is just that the Fall schedule of the sun is getting later and later. The weather forecast for New Orleans called for stormy weather later in the day and checking the radar as we left town confirmed that we were in for a day of driving in some nasty weather. A huge line of thunderstorms was just moving through San Antonio and Houston and slowly moving its way east.</p>
<p>We actually had to pull over in Beaumont at a rest stop to wait out the worst of the weather. Parked between a huge fifth-wheel camper and a big 18-wheeler we were pretty sheltered from the wind. So we ate an early lunch, checked our mail and watched the rain pound the windshield. With the worst of the storm past us we still drove through heavy rain until just outside of Houston. At which point the wind really picked up and was gusting to 36 mph. That made the drive from Houston to San Antonio pretty difficult.</p>
<p>By the time we got to the RV park it was after 5:00 so we had been on the road for 11 hours and were ready to just relax and have a drink. We cooked some steaks and topped them with left over warmed up crab sauce from Galatoires. Quite good.</p>
<p>Thursday morning we had a leisurely breakfast and then took off on our bikes for a nice little ride on the Saldado greenway that runs right by the KOA. Our neighbor warned us that the trail was flooded in several areas, but speculated that it might be dried out by now. He was correct except for a couple of slippery muddy areas.</p>
<p>After showering and finishing off some left over pizza for lunch we headed to downtown San Antonio to visit the Alamo and find a good dinner spot on the Riverwalk. The Alamo took a lot less time that we expected and the Riverwalk was pretty quiet. Lots of volunteers were working to set up chairs for the river parade to celebrate the “Day of the Dead”. Unfortunately that parade is for Saturday night so we did not get to see it but I bet it would be pretty cool.</p>
<p>We ended up at the Iron Cactus for a very early of mexican food and Margaritas. It was good, but not great. I had some chicken enchiladas verde and jane had fish tacos. We thought about having a campfire when we got back to the camper, but the wind was still very strong so we decided to hold off on that and play some games in the camper instead.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We arrived in New Orleans on Sunday, not the best day to visit restaurants, but we were able to make it work for us.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sunday Night Galatoires on Bourbon Street</li>
<li>Monday Midday food tour of the French Quarter</li>
<li>Tuesday Night Commanders Palace in the Garden District</li>
</ul>
<p>That is quite a lineup! Both Galatoires and Commanders Palace required coats for men, so I had to bring a sport coat all the way down the river just for these two nights. It was definitely worth it. Also, New Orleans requires proof of vaccination to even enter a restaurant or bar! Good for them</p>
<p>We started with a pre-dinner drink at the Absinthe Bar, where we happened to sit next to two women from LaCrosse Wisconsin! I had never had an Absinthe drink before, but it was a real treat. If you don’t know, Absinthe tastes a lot like black licorice.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5351e9787f.png" alt="Light your drink on fire!"></p>
<p>Galatoires is an old school restaurant, white and black tile on the floor, mirrors on the walls, servers dressed in black suits. Very nice. We started with a potato souffle, which was very thin slices of potato that were somehow fried and puffed in the middle, served with a nice aioli. We were advised to eat them quickly, before they deflated and we had no trouble following that advice. We followed that up with a bowl of gumbo that was spicy and brown and very delicious with chunks of shrimp and sausage.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/454cdc7b43.png" alt="Bourbon Street"></p>
<p>For our main course I had been waiting to try some New Orleans Shrimp Etouffee, which did not disappoint. Everything starts with the Roux and I’m on a new mission to make a nice dark brown Roux. Jane had a combo meal of a very rich crab dish Crab Ravigote - think crab dip - and Shrimp au Vin. It was so good but we brought most of the crab dish home with us. (something to top our steaks with tonight!)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c7feb25ef1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Monday we had a fun food tour, it was a nice small tour group. The other six all knew each other and were from Washington state. They had just finished a seven day river cruise from Memphis to New Orleans. I’m not sure why you would do a food tour of New Orleans if you didn’t want to try shrimp gumbo but whatever. They enjoyed their red beans and rice instead. On the tour we tasted the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>seafood sausages - shrimp, crawfish, cheese and rice in a casing. The inside tasted great, but the casings were kind of distracting as they didn’t want to break so the sausage just kind of squirted out.</li>
<li>Shrimp Gumbo — did you know that the word Gumbo originated in Africa and is the word for Ochre?</li>
<li>Jambalaya</li>
<li>Fried Alligator bites with Muffaletta Sandwich</li>
<li>Wood Fired Oysters with parmesan and butter! This is the way to have Oysters! <img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ae42c64a63.png" alt=""></li>
<li>Pralines for desert!</li>
</ul>
<p>Our guide, Jack, was very knowledgeable and did a great job of mixing in the history of the French Quarter with food talk.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/415317c46a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Tuesday evening, we had dinner at Commanders Palace — a fitting meal to celebrate the end of the ride! We headed into the Garden District with plenty of time to check out the architecture as well as a few of the bars. We actually ended up having a little taco appetizer at The Rum House. Commanders palace is one of the oldest restaurants in the country and has had many famous chefs including Paul Prudhomme and Emeril LeGasse. The food was delicious once again. We had to have more Gumbo but for my Entree I had to go for the pork chop served over polenta. Jane had the pecan crusted fish — a Paul Prudhomme creation. For desert we even had to try the bread pudding which was quite delicious.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday was the official end of my Mississippi River ride. I rode way out on the delta to Venice, or the southernmost strip of land in the state of Louisiana. A few parts of the ride were scenic but a lot of it was still just along the highway. Thankfully the traffic heading out that direction is pretty light, so even though it was a four lane road I could have one lane to myself.</p>
<p>I got off to a bit of a rocky start as I thought I was just going to follow the highway, but a mile into the ride I checked the map only to discover I was off track. So I did a U-turn and headed back to my missed turn onto a nice side road. After a mile or so on the side road I could see a bridge ahead and the dreaded orange highway signs. The bridge was out! My only option was to go back to the highway I had left and continue as I thought! The highway bridge</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/75d0ad477d.png" alt="The Gulf and the River Meet!"></p>
<p>Miles later, and just a couple miles short of the end I could see our pickup sitting beside the road. Jane was waiting for me to give me the news that the road ahead was under water. Not deep, but definitely not bikeable.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/649532fe61.png" alt=""></p>
<p>So we put my bike in the bed of the pickup, and fittingly drove the last two miles to the southernmost point in Louisiana where I did pose for my final photo op.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f086769011.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To recap, Jane and I covered 2,550 miles from the headwaters of the Mississippi at Lake Itasca to this pretty un-flashy finish line. I didn’t ride every mile of that but I rode the majority of it for sure. I learned a lot about the limitations of my body and the day after day grind of riding a long distance.</p>
<p>The drive back to our campground outside of New Orleans was pretty uneventful. We had to take a ferry across the river at the cost of $1.00. It runs every 30 minutes and appears to take about a dozen cars each trip. Definitely not a money maker when you consider the crew of three!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/20712bd656.png" alt="View from the ferry"></p>
<p>We really enjoyed looking at all of the large houses up on stilts! We even saw two entire high school buildings built on stilts! Very new, so we were guessing these schools were built with money from FEMA after Katrina. Here is a nice example of one of the fine houses we saw.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/52c321c5ab.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As I write this we are about an hour away from our campground in San Antonio! We have covered more miles today than we would do in a week while I was biking! We left early this morning under the cover of darkness and its been quite a trip. The severe weather that is affecting the entire country made no exception for our day of travel. We had to pull over to a rest stop outside of Beaumont Texas to wait out a severe thunderstorm. It was an early lunch but it worked nicely to park in between an 18 wheeler and a fifth-wheel camper.</p>
<p>We enjoyed 3 fun nights in New Orleans which I will cover in a separate post! We have about a week of travel left before we arrive in Indio with more adventures yet to come. We are looking forward to a visit to the Alamo tomorrow and some of the great national parks in the state of Texas.</p>

			 <p>After days of really flat, really boring, riding / non-riding today was a welcome breath of fresh air. The Natchez trace is a really nice ride! Its a two lane road with a 50 mph speed limit and very few cars.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bdc151d26b.png" alt="The Natchez Trace"></p>
<p>The trace dates back to prehistoric times when bison followed the same path from the river to the Nashville area. Later native Americans and others would “trace” the same path. Natchez is the oldest western settlement on the Mississippi river dating back to 1746.</p>
<p>Today Jane and I did the ride as a relay. She dropped me off and I rode for 28 miles, testing my lower back which seemed to survive the ride quite well. Meanwhile, Jane hiked a bit and then drove on ahead of me and parked the truck and camper so it would be waiting for me. Then she took off on her bike heading towards Natchez, a little more than 33 miles. I drove the camper to our camp site and got everything set up for the night.</p>
<p>The day did not start well as we had a nail in one of our camper tires so the pressure was way down, and my removal of said nail did not make the situation any better. We slowly made our way to a Vicksburg tire shop about 5 miles from our campground. The place was a pretty low budget place, with no big bays or fancy equipment, but where the most friendly guy helped us out! I went inside — no counter, no receptionist — and waited next to a guy remounting a tire on a rim. When our tech noticed me he asked how he could help and I told him of our trouble. He followed me out and had us pull the trailer a bit further forward. He grabbed a jack and a “bacon strip” patch kit and his compressor hose. Less than 10 minutes later he was done. The charges were a shockingly low $10.00! I only had a 20 dollar bill and he didn’t have any change so we agreed to call it good at $20 and we were on our way. I was so elated that we didn’t have to sit around for hours waiting to get something done that it seemed like a bargain!</p>
<p>The “bacon strip” kit is a larger version of what I use for my fat tire bike. So now we are wondering if we can buy our own larger version for the camper as well.</p>
<p>After getting showered at our campsite we both realized that we hadn’t had anything to eat since breakfast, so we headed into town to the Natchez Brewery for a beer and some very good pizza. I’m suspecting it will be an early night.</p>

			 <p>Due to my back pain I rode with Jane today from the Mississippi River state park to Lake Chicot state park. I’m not too sad as it was 80 miles of highway riding through flat (and mostly harvested) cotton fields was not so appealing.</p>
<p>After crossing the river into Arkansas we were ready to get to our campground. Google maps wanted us to turn right, so of course we did. The road sign for the state park said to go straight but hey, what do they know. A hundred yards later we were screwed&hellip;. We were on the North Levee road with no way to turn around. Think Gravel, dust, and steep grades on both sides of the narrow gravel road.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4890c2deaf.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Crap! 7.2 miles and then we are supposed to turn left onto Audubon Trail. Which then goes to our campsite. What else can we do except take it nice and slow, raise as little dust as possible, and hope that nobody comes from the other direction!</p>
<p>Well, 7.2 miles later we get to our turn for the Audubon trail and that is exactly what it is! A trail! The road goes left but at the bottom of the levee is a gate, chained closed. I hop out to investigate and see if it is locked and what is on the other side of the gate. Well it isn’t locked but the other side of the gate has not seen any traffic in a very very long time. We would be driving in a pasture, with a barely discernible path. 100% something you would never pull a camper on!!</p>
<p>At this point our only option is to curse Google in the most colorful language possible, and try to very carefully turn the camper around by backing into the turnoff. Jane very skillfully backs the camper onto the ramp and then begins to pull to go back the other way. The wheels begin to spin. No way!! stop and go and spin, stop and go and&hellip;. the traction catches and we are turned around. Now all we have to do is drive another 7.2 miles back the other way on the same dusty gravel.</p>
<p>By the time we get back to the main road, the truck is beige instead of nearly black. The camper is covered in dust, and neither of us is in a very good mood. We follow the signs toward the state park and I thoughtfully suggest deleting the Google maps application from Jane’s phone. This way is about 17 miles longer than Google’s way but it is much better and we arrive safely. The ranger gives me a knowing chuckle when I suggest that maybe the park should have a notice to ignore Google maps when trying to get to the campground. We are not the first! Nor will we be the last I suspect.</p>
<p>We will follow the instructions to try to get Google to make a correction.</p>
<p>In the meantime for the search engine side of google here are some key words that may help the next unsuspecting traveller.</p>
<p>Arkansas Chicot State Park, directions, Audubon trail, north levee road, ignore google!! Audubon trail is NOT a road!!</p>

			 <p>My back felt better this morning, and with 52 miles on the schedule it felt very doable. Especially with all my new ointments to soothe my muscles and keep my rear end happy.</p>
<p>The challenge for the day was that in addition to riding, and needing to move to the next campground, I was also supposed to participate in the Concordia College October board meeting. What to do? Most of the morning was scheduled as committee meetings and the student learning committee had no important votes to make today, so I decided I would ride during that meeting and <em>attempt</em> to participate via zoom as I rode. It mostly worked fine! I was able to listen to 90% of the meeting as I had at least two bars of Verizon LTE for the majority of the ride!</p>
<p>The only part I could not participate in was during opening introductions when I happened to be down in a very pretty valley — I guess they call them hollers down here in Kentucky? In any case I didn’t have service for a while.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c5199573ec.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m going to claim that this is the first time ever that a Concordia regent has participated in a board meeting, virtually, while riding 52 miles.</p>
<p>Tonight we are camped out at Reel Foot Lake State Park. We have a beautiful spot right on the lake.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c6bcab75e0.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Getting into this spot was quite the trick! First we had to back down a lane and then make a sharp turn around a tree, while avoiding another tree with the pickup! Thankfully I married a pro backer upper, and with my expert hand signals 👉👈 we were settled in no time!</p>
<p>A relatively early arrival allowed me to participate in the afternoon session from the comfort of our couch, and thankfully we have a good signal at this campground!</p>

			 <p>Today was another 50 mile day, but thankfully the weather was 180 degrees from yesterday. Cool, sunny, and with a very light breeze that was <em>almost</em> behind me. I even saw my first dead armadillo on the side of the road! Oh joy!</p>
<p>After yesterday, which I will always think of as “the ride from hell,” I did a lot of thinking about this journey. I had a lot of time to think as the river was not visible and the scenery was a lot of cropland! One thing that I said to Jane and many others was that we are doing this for fun. If it isn’t fun then why do it? Yesterday was not fun. Enduring 50-70 miles a day on roads where you have to contend with traffic is not fun. Even without traffic which is also the case four to six hours on the bike every day is a pretty lonely experience. There are only so many podcasts to listen to.</p>
<p>According to our guide book for the MRT we are headed into more of the ride that is not very pretty and just miles and miles on roads. The sense of accomplishment at the end of the day is fun, but it all too soon turns into another morning and getting back on the bike. This trip has been hard on my body as well. The ride in the wind really took a toll on my back.</p>
<p>East Saint Louis was NOT fun for Jane either. The RV park was nothing but a giant parking lot behind the Casino. She volunteered to ride across the bridge to a bike shop to pick up some new tubes for our tires and some urrrrmmmm “Chamois Cream” for my developing chafing problem. Brand name “DZNutz” 😂 On the way back from that errand she hit a patch of broken glass and suffered another flat. Thankfully she was close enough to just walk the bike back to the camper. This was a good reminder that this trip is not much of a vacation for her. Hooking up the camper, taking care of the “black water,” filling the fresh water, all the stuff that we normally do together when camping she is having to do alone.</p>
<p>So, all of those things were turning over and over in my mind as I rode and I think it leads to one conclusion. A little less riding and a little more fun. Maybe more hiking, maybe just some shorter rides in areas that are pretty. Maybe just more time together enjoying our campsites and what they have to offer. It doesn’t mean I’m giving up — the killer nagging feeling in the back of my mind. Lets just say I am reprioritizing the activities of the trip!</p>
<p>Jane met me with the camper a several miles short of the camp site for the night and we rode those last miles together. We talked about my thoughts from the day, and considered skipping the campground for tonight and moving on to the next so that we could have a couple of nights in the same place. Luckily we decided that we should at least drive through the campground and see what it was like. Luckily we did! Our campground was a real find! Called Fort Kaskaskia, the campground was first come first served. Other than a few campers that were obviously there for the season we had our pick of sites. After getting camp set up we walked back to the main picnic shelter where we had a spectacular view of the mississippi.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7b7eea042a.png" alt="Kaskaskia - the sunken town"></p>
<p>This area has a very interesting history. The mississippi changed directions here at one point putting part of Illinois to the west of the river. It was also the site of a revolutionary war battle! Yes revolutionary not civil, I never knew there were revolutionary war battles fought this far west. We met a nice couple who had lived in the area their whole lives who had just come up to the fort after a doctors appointment to enjoy the view. They enjoyed sharing some of the history of the area with us and it was fun to hear it from them.</p>

			 <p>This is one of the most beautiful state parks with really nice campsites.</p>
<p>After riding nearly 60 miles today, my back was so sore that I knew my long distance riding days were numbered. The rest of the way will be finding some shorter, more scenic/nicer routes to ride to fulfill the spirit of this trip.</p>
<p>The truth is that riding 100 miles on the edge of a highway through flat farmland lost its appeal. This really is the part of the ride where things get kind of flat and boring. I’m looking forward to that last days ride to the Gulf.</p>

			 <p>Today I saw fields of cotton ready for harvest for the first time in my life. What a sight! Acres of white “flowers” against a backdrop of green.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8635409321.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After breaking camp at lake Reel Foot and riding for a while with Jane I got on my bike for the last 52 miles into our destination of Fort Pillow. Less than 100 yards from starting my ride I was chased by two dogs. Of course this was going to happen as I had just commented to Jane that of all the things so far the last couple of weeks I was glad that I hadn’t had to cope with dogs! These two were just a dramatic foreshadowing of my day to come. Following the MRT took me through lots of pockets of rural houses on very lightly traveled roads. But every house had at least one dog and all of them wanted to greet me in some way. None of them attacked, but when you are on a bike it is never fun to have dogs running beside you or in front of you, you just don’t know what they will do.</p>
<p>In addition to the cotton fields I also saw a lot of Kudzu forests. Kudzu is an invasive plant species introduced from Japan. It can grow a foot a day and loves to cover the native trees giving the forests that have been taken over by the Kudzu quite an interesting look!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f2cd268808.png" alt="Kudzu forest"><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/3c72f778cd.png" alt="More Kudzu!"></p>
<p>Today’s ride was also super hilly! The final few miles up to the campground at Fort Pillow almost did me in! I’m very happy that this should be one of the last hilly rides, the rest of the way to Louisiana should be pretty flat.</p>
<p>I’ve read quite a bit about the civil war but had never heard of a general Pillow. Turns out he didn’t last long and neither did the fort. Less than a year from completion the fort was abandoned by the confederacy. It was a very nice campground, and it was a beautiful Fall night. A good chance to have a campfire and enjoy some well earned steaks after a hard ride!</p>
<p>Tomorrow Jane and I plan to do an easy ride on a bike path on the way to Memphis, then I’m planning to take a couple days off as we rest up and take in a few of the sites in Memphis. Hopefully some BBQ on Beale street is in my future.</p>

			 <p>From Fort Kaskaskia we drove to the Trail of Tears State Park. This park marks the spot where thousands of Cherokee were driven across the Mississippi river in a forced relocation to reservations in the west. Over 1/4 of the Cherokee died on the trip. A shameful part of our past.</p>
<p>The campground here is small and remote, except for the railroad tracks that run right next to the campground and river. For some reason the engineers feel it necessary to blow their whistles in the middle of the night for the tiny trail that crosses the tracks from the campground to the river. Needless to say this was not our best nights sleep.</p>
<p>But I’m getting ahead of myself. We were only about 10 miles from Cape Girardeau a beautiful river town, with murals on the cement flood wall that tell the story of the town. On our way into town we stopped at the Cape Bicycle shop to stock up on some supplies. I had a great chat with one of the guys in the store (owner maybe). He gave me some good riding advice, and some recommendations on where we could get a good pizza and some local brew. Minglewood brewery was the place. We were able to hang out, enjoy some beer, tater-tot nachos, and pizza while watching the US Mens national team. I would recommend both Minglewood and the cycle shop if you are passing through.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/0fd377231c.png" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/86d8276a80.png" alt=""><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2466c67faf.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After a pretty bad nights sleep, my back was hurting, so I just did a short ride around on the park roads.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/413d1fcba8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Jane had taken off with the truck to do a hike and I had left my helmet in the truck. So I didn’t want to go on the highway and I didn’t want to go far or fast anyway, so a gentle ride to stretch my muscles was all I wanted. Jane’s hike was like a trip through the jungle, she had to use her walking sticks to clear away the spider webs!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/98e584cd40.png" alt=""></p>
<p>One of the things the guys in the bike shop told me, which of course Jane already knew, was not to ride across this bridge!!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cb395f1f0c.png" alt="Do NOT ride or walk your bike over this very narrow bridge."></p>
<p>Since it was a day to ride in the truck, I did not! Instead we rode together to Columbus Belmont state park. After setting up camp I had just enough signal to participate in the afternoon plenary session of the Concordia board meeting.</p>
<p>Our campground host was very welcoming, and was willing to deliver a nice load of wood for just $5. This was great as we made some pork satays over an open fire along with couscous and chickpeas.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today started out promising. Like any morning in the camper I made myself some coffee. Unlike most mornings the cell service at Pere Marquette was so bad that the best my devices could muster was a few received emails overnight. Despite Two bars of service digital was just out of the question. Obviously this cell is not designed to handle the volume of traffic at the park. Anything real time was out of the question.</p>
<p>I did pull up the weather and managed to get a frame of radar. Not good! We turned on the TV since we got good TV reception and the weatherman summed it up. Rain this morning, then 30 mph winds for the afternoon with severe weather to follow after noon and late this afternoon. Ugh! So we walked up to the lodge where they had super-fast wifi and confirmed all of this. Yep, lots of rain on the way, then what looked like a break, maybe followed by more rain.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4549c3af32.png" alt="Great contrast! Great Flag.  Non-Trumpers can be patriotic too!"></p>
<p>OK, so I’ll work this morning and leave after the rain hopefully finishing before the afternoon showers hit! Great idea. Around 11:00 we saw the sun, so I helped Jane get the camper hooked up, then got my stuff ready and headed out on my bike. The trail, which I had been looking forward to, was a mess! Mud puddles, Mud, downed tree branches, etc. My legs were caked with mud before I had gone 6 miles. The wind out of the SSE was quickly becoming a pain.</p>
<p>When I saw Jane go by on the highway I thought “maybe she’ll stop and I’ll be done for the day.” No such luck, OK, I am going to do this I told myself. It seems that cross country biking is a battle of will! Then I got on the highway where the bike lane was nicer, but the wind was fierce. I continued on for another 15 miles, not making great progress, until I noticed I was no longer on the route. Somewhere the bike path had gone to the right but I had continued following the highway. But just ahead was a turnout where I could get back on the path. I’m not sure I should have as the path was on top of the levee, well above the highway! At times I was riding at a 20 degree angle into the side wind! But I don’t think my day was as challenging as this barge driver! He was trying to get the barges into the lock but clearly heading for the shore due to the high winds!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/a6a830db03.png" alt="crooked barge"></p>
<p>I seemed to continue along the top of the levee in the wind forever. At the Lewis and Clark memorial I contemplated calling Jane again, but I kept on going. About two miles after the memorial I really regretted my decision as the bike path inexplicably turned to gravel, nice rain softened gravel! That continued for at least two or three miles until I got to the bridge to cross the Mississippi back into Missouri. Getting off the levee and back onto the road was hard as the path was chained shut. I felt very isolated and alone, and it looked like nobody had biked this path for years. Tires, old furniture, all kinds of crap had been thrown off the bridge I was to cross… Yuk!</p>
<p>A few miles later I crossed the beautiful “Chain of Rocks” bridge. Definitely a sight to behold, but by the time I got to the end of the bridge it was pouring. Thankfully there was a covered rest area at the end of the bridge. This time I did call Jane. But she was on her bike headed out to meet me! She is amazing, she was headed out to meet me so I could draft off her on her ebike for the final 10 miles. “I’m almost to the chain of rocks bridge” she said. “OK, its letting up, I’ll meet you” I replied. But I kept riding and riding and no sign of her! So I brought here up on “Find my Friends” Ok I’m getting close but she doesn’t seem to be moving! At that point I got a little nervous, but as I got to the point where here icon was on find my and my blue dot showed me, I could see she was standing. Waiting for me? Nope she had ridden through a pile of glass and had a flat tire! Also no spare tube or tire changing tools. How could I let her ride without a spare!!??</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/0436b77aea.png" alt="Beautiful clouds"></p>
<p>Maybe an Uber was the solution, but I didn’t like the idea of her waiting around for me to get back to her, or her riding in an Uber and me just hanging out for an hour for her to come back. So I tried the first step. Just pump up the tire again. No go! Ok, my tubes are not made for her tires, but they will definitely work in a pinch. So I took off her tire and replaced the tube with my spare. We vowed to carry our bikes over the area with the glass. That was enough to get us back to the RV park at the King Power / Queens casino RV park in St. Louis.</p>
<p>Back in the camper, my back is sore from fighting the wind all day and my attitude is marginal at best. I can’t decide if I want to say I made it halfway down the Mississippi or if I want to continue.</p>
<p>Parts of this ride are great and beautiful, and parts of the trip are just gross.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ede731a927.png" alt="train yards, junk yards, industrial mississippi"></p>
<p>We will see what tomorrow brings but my bet is on me continuing despite past challenges, and future worries. This feels to me like one of those junior high english class “man against nature” challenges, and in the moment that is exactly what it is! What me give up?! Never! On the other hand I only did this because I thought it would be fun. Today was not fun, today was a whole lotta work. I beat the wind and rain and the elements, but at the end of the day I’m tired and my back hurts, and the Alleve isn’t working, and I’m no fun for Jane to hang out with. So we will see what tomorrow brings!</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>

			 <p>I awoke with heavy legs this morning! The plan was for Jane to drive me back across the river, retracing part of my ride from yesterday. Then, to drop me off so I could ride to the State Park. Sometimes things don’t go quite as planned.</p>
<p>A mile or two into the ride, maybe even less I noticed that I had a flat. Not so bad, I haven’t had any flat tires for quite a while now. So I pulled over to make the change only to discover that I had left my pump in the camper! Thankfully Jane was only a few miles down the road, and I had cell service. She came back with the pump and another tire and a bit later I was changed and on my way.</p>
<p>Less than a mile down the road I was flat again. Grrr&hellip; Maybe it was the tired legs, or the heat, or whatever but that was the last straw for me. On the phone again to Jane. “I guess I was not meant to ride today.” So back she came again. As I was waiting I took the whole tire off and once again felt inch by inch to see if I could find something. Finally I found a tiny sharp spine that had somehow worked its way through. I had missed it the first time around but not now. Still, when Jane got back I put the bike on the rack and hopped in the truck.</p>
<p>I sat there stewing and angry about flat tires for quite a few miles before I finally decided that maybe it was time to pull off, fix the tire and ride the rest of the way.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4595637dfd.png" alt="Fixing a flat"></p>
<p>The first part of the abbreviated ride was from Hamberg, which was on some beautiful country roads. Here I am as Jane decided to follow me for a few miles just to be sure.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/23d525e15a.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The second part of the ride was along a pretty busy Illinois Hwy 100. Not so great, but here I am crossing the Illinois river about 15 miles short of Pere Marquette State Park.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8b93ecd6db.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We put the Instant Pot to work to make some ribs which we finished over our campfire and some cheesy rice. Tomorrow is scheduled to be a day of rest.</p>

			 <p>Although today was a “day of rest” we still made a short ride into Grafton for lunch. I’ll ride this same path again tomorrow so this made up for a little of yesterday’s ride in the truck.</p>
<p>As we rode into town I saw this big sign, “Bikers Welcome”</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bc0b1e7e0b.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Nice! I thought until we noticed the 100 or so Harleys parked outside. The banner in the back is also advertising “The Hawg Pit”. Needless to say we did not stop there for our lunch. We continued on to the Grafton Brewhouse and Winery where we had some pretty good burgers and decent beer. I think they source some of their grapes from California as I did have a nice chardonnay. Good enough that I bought a bottle.</p>

			 <p>Today was a total washout. I woke up and looked at the forecast and radar only to see a huge patch of rain heading our way. Strangely from east to west. I guess we are in the south now? I just had time to get the bike on the rack and get them covered up before the rain started. So we had a nice breakfast and watched the radar. Clearly an all day thing. I am not into riding all day in the rain so today became a day off. When the rain finally did let up, we did a short hike at Wildcat Den State Park and then drove to Nauvoo.</p>
<p>Here is what it looks like when you are the only camper in the campground!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f14428a7c7.png" alt="Lonely Campground"></p>
<p>Nauvoo, home to the grave of Joseph Smith and one really big Mormon temple looked like a pretty sleepy little town as we pulled in. The town turned out to be larger than we thought, but it was still pretty quiet. After setting up camp we took a short walk to the oldest winery in Illinois. We keep trying to convince ourselves that we will find a good wine somewhere along the Mississippi. 🤣</p>
<p>The morning came and the sun was out, a great day to ride to ride. the first part of the day was beautiful, following the river right at river level.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4385b5ffff.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As the day wore on I got further away from the river and more into farmland as well as higher temperatures and a bit of a southern breeze. A different kind of scenery but it was fun to see the harvest in progress.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/50f4a4bd2d.png" alt="Fall Harvest in Illinois"></p>
<p>Heading into Hannibal I rode across the Mississippi on I72 - the only stretch of Interstate in Illinois where bikes are allowed. At this point I was getting pretty tired of riding into the wind and I was low on water, so thankfully I was getting close. After the bridge it was all downhill into Hannibal. Unfortunately our campground was not in downtown, it was outside of Hannibal on the other side of a hill!</p>
<p>One shower and a gallon of water later I was ready to head back into town. We decided, unsurprisingly, on a pizza/pasta place called the brick oven. We were lucky I was ready for an early supper as by the time we left there was a very long waiting list.</p>
<p>Of course when in town you have to stop and help Tom Sawyer whitewash a fence.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/b9ba4be246.png" alt="I thought I was cleverly hiding my leftovers while whitewashing…"></p>
<p>On the way back to camp we stopped at Lovers Leap where we had a beautiful view of the river and Hannibal.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/484841a856.png" alt="The Mississippi and Hannibal MO near sunset"></p>
<p>I did manage to stay awake until 10, even knowing that I had another 80 miles on the schedule for the next day.</p>

			 <p>Today I did 86 miles but it was a very relaxing day of riding. The majority of the day was on trails and it was nice to be away from traffic and goats. At one point I was riding right along the top of the levee but most of the time was just through nice rural roads and trails.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f11e1dbdd8.png" alt="Riding through the woods"></p>
<p>I had to make a stop at the local Caseys to buy a couple of bottles of water since I somehow managed to leave the camper with everything but my water bottles. I now have a morning checklist to make sure I don’t forget stuff!</p>

<p>My route today took me through Cordova, where I stopped for lunch and enjoyed the view of the river as well as through East Moline, and Davenport. My one little snag was the bike trail through the parks area of Davenport was closed due to some emergency training drills, so I had to detour on a little busier road.</p>

<p>When I arrived at our destination for the night near Muscatine, Jane was sitting in the parking area. It turns out that checkout time is not until 4:00 and the people occupying our site for the night were going to get every last minute out of their stay. After 4:00 there was still no sign they were leaving, and I was sweaty and grumpy and out of patience so I went over to the sight to politely ask when they planned on moving along. It wasn’t the most pleasant conversation I’ve had, but it did get the job done!</p>

<p>For dinner we had spaghetti and salad. I had not even finished my spaghetti when I had to do a Zoom meeting with a group of students who are working on a project for Runestone for their Senior Capstone. I don’t mind working from the road especially when we have a decent signal. My schedule is a bit unpredictable depending on how far I’m riding and what the weather is, but I seem to be able to keep up with email and do a little development work in my downtime.</p>

			 <p>After a wonderful weekend in Decorah for our 35 year class reunion, we arrived at Pike’s Peak state park just after dark. This was to be our first time of setting up cam in the dark, but we were not too worried, until we saw a pickup in our spot. Nobody was around and it was just sitting there taking up space. I hopped out of the truck and knocked on the door of the fifth-wheel next door. No answer. Same with the popup on the other side. Grrrr! Suddenly a nice man came quickly down the road. “Sorry, Sorry, I thought this was vacant for tonight and I wanted to recharge a few things. Our spot is not electric!” OK, no problem he moved his truck and we were all good. Time to get a good nights sleep to prepare for the ride.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1d0d2c0c5f.png" alt="Ready to Ride"></p>
<p>Yesterday was the start of the final push of this journey. Iowa to the Gulf of Mexico! And what a ride it was, 58 miles with lots and lots of climbing. At times I was cruising along high above the river with great views and other times it was just me and my friends.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cf667fdaa0.png" alt="Ummmm&hellip;. Cows"></p>
<p>Mostly the roads were good and the motorists were all very courteous. I had a good shoulder to ride on most of the time. I could definitely tell that I had not been doing enough climbing as my back was a little sore and my neck muscles were too by the time I finished the ride for the day.</p>

<p>After arriving at the campground in Dubuque Jane was just setting up camp, so I helped finish that task and then did some stretching. We had plans to have dinner with Rachel’s parents (Greg and Peggy Miller) and it turned out to be a wonderful evening. I had some great pasta (Carbs!!) at L May in downtown Dubuque.</p>
<p>This is going to be a great trip. We will see if we settle into a rhythm, but its kind of nice to wake up, have a few hours to work, answer emails, etc. before jumping on the bike again.</p>

			 <p>02 Bemidji to Brainerd - My First Century</p>
<p>Yesterday the ride from Itasca to Bemidji turned out to be shorter than expected by 10 miles. Today’s ride turned out to be longer than expected by a good 10 miles. Yesterday started out with a flat tire after only 10 miles. But after the flat the ride was easy and interesting. I crossed the Mississippi “river” several times.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/8788a391e0.jpg" alt="The Mississippi in its not so mighty phase"></p>
<p>Today began bright and early with a 6:40AM departure from our campsite at Lake Bemidji State Park. The temps were cool, and a stiff breeze out of the south kept me feeling good. Later I would come to appreciate that breeze less and less and the temperatures rose and my legs got more tired. Early in the ride you cross the Mississippi as it exits from Lake Bemidji.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/4cd0c49ddc.jpg" alt="The mississippi coming out of Lake Bemidji"></p>
<p>After that, the Paul Bunyan trail does not cross the mississippi like the Mississippi River Trail, but is an official alternate for the MRT, almost all of is on abandoned rail beds and is pretty flat. Everything was very pretty with the morning light.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/f0f8839b94.jpg" alt="Little Valley"></p>
<p>except for one section around Walker (about 50 miles in) that was not very flat, and came at exactly the wrong time in my ride.</p>
<p>At the 79 mile mark Jane was waiting for me with Lunch! It was about 20 miles further than I was ready for it, but that is part of what this first leg of the journey is about. Figuring things out, learning what gear we need and what my limits are.</p>
<p>After lunch my legs were still feeling tired, and the wind kept getting stronger and stronger out of the south. Also less of the trail was tree lined so that made the breeze and the sun both stronger.</p>
<p>I made it to the 100 mile mark!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/04ff66daee.jpg" alt="100 Miles! My first Century!  Still 20 miles to go."></p>
<p>Unfortunately after making 100 it was clear that I still had at least 20 miles left to go. At that point I knew I could make it to Brainerd, but I was probably not going to make it to our campsite south of Brainerd for the night. That is why we have the truck!</p>
<p>Now I’m sitting in the camper writing this post and encouraging my legs to recover their strength for tomorrow. Tomorrow and Thursday are much shorter 68 miles tomorrow and 58 miles on Thursday. Should be a piece of cake!</p>

			 <p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/2b0b26c7fe.jpg" alt="Standing at the headwaters.  I remember wading here when I was much younger."></p>
<p>We had a lovely 20 mile ride around Lake Itasca planned for today with a stop at the headwaters of the Mississippi. As the sign says, 2552 miles! That is roughly the length of our journey, in three parts — Its a long way, but at least it is downhill! For those who don’t know what I’m going on about, here is the story.</p>
<p>Sometime earlier this year I said it would be fun to ride the Mississippi from start to finish. It turns out there is a popular route known as the Mississippi River Trail. Its not a bike path but an established route of trails and roads leading from Itasca State Park in Minnesota all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. I’ll be riding my bike and Jane will be riding a bit, pulling the camper, hiking and providing support.</p>
<p>Part I is the ride from Itasca to Minneapolis. This will take place Monday through Thursday this week. It features my first 100+ mile day from Bemidji to Brainerd on the Paul Bunyan trail.</p>
<p>Part II is the ride from Minneapolis to Lansing Iowa. This will be three days starting Labor Day. We’ll end up camping in Decorah prior to Josh and Rachel’s much delayed wedding celebration with friends and family. All fully vaccinated, we hope.</p>
<p>Part III will be from Lansing to the Gulf starting October 4th. We will be back at Luther for our 35 year class Reunion and when that is over we will take off down the river. Most days will be 60 - 70 miles but as we get further south and the route gets flatter I’ll have a few 100+ days.</p>

<p>Our ride today was not what we expected since the wilderness road was closed due to downed trees and a high fire forrest fire risk 🌲 🔥. So we ended up doing more of the ride on the wonderful state park trails.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I’ll rest my legs for a day and then Monday I will take off for Bemidji.</p>

			 <p>Well, I think it is time to head East. When we started making our egg scramble for breakfast this morning the sausage had mold on it, and so did one of our bags of shredded cheese! Its nothing that a stop at a grocery store won’t fix, but we are both ready anyway. We’ve been on the road with the camper for 20 days, and it has been quite a trip.</p>
<p>The last few days have been really wonderful. We got to park the camper at Lake Chelan State Park and hang out with our friends Jim and Karen for three days! Jim and Karen are experts on the Chelan and Leavenworth areas having both lived in the area before, so they had lots of great outings planned for us.</p>
<p>Day One, we met at the Wal-mart parking lot to leave the camper until check-in time and headed out for a wine tasting and lunch! We found a great location at Benson’s who also served a great local wood fired pizza. Check out this amazing view of Lake Chelan from our lunch stop!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/847e7e8326.jpg" alt="Wine and lunch at Benson’s winery"></p>
<p>That pretty much captures the area in a nutshell. Everywhere you go you are treated to amazing views of the lake. By the time we finished lunch and our tasting it was late enough to move the camper to the campground.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/1f1adae372.jpg" alt="Beautiful campsite at Lake Chelan State Park"></p>
<p>With the camper situated, we were able to explore the south side of the lake and see the Holden guest house that Jim helped build many years ago. We had another pre-dinner wine tasting at the Tsillan (pronounced Chelan) winery. The weather was HOT 95+ degrees. The wine was also really good. I’m bringing home bottles of Rosé and Pinot Grigio. Dinner was in downtown Chelan at Campbells, followed by a campfire back at our site. There were two big RV’s next door to us, each with a gaggle of kids and their bikes. The kids were riding their bikes back and forth, no hands, getting as close as they could to Jim and Karen’s car parked in front of our camper! This was making both Jim and Karen very nervous, and they were ready to make the drive back to their place anyway, so they left. Meanwhile the biking and the squeaky bike brakes continued long after dark! We laughed that we are edging ever closer to those old people that yell “get off my lawn!”</p>
<p>Tuesday morning, Jim and I headed out for a ride up the lake. It was perfect weather and a great morning for a ride. My fat tire had to work hard to keep up with Jim’s road bike.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/80174e0bb8.jpg" alt="Trying to Keep up with Jim"></p>
<p>We had bratwurst for lunch at the campground, and then Jim and Karen took off to take care of some family things. We were also awaiting the arrival of Jane’s aunt Joanne and uncle Dale. Her cousin David drove them up from Yakima to see us. This is Jane’s last remaining aunt and uncle and we haven’t seen them in years so it was great to see them and have a chance to chat.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/8fda9b38bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Wednesday, the plan was to head to Leavenworth, where Karen’s parents and cousins live. Karen had a favorite hike for us to do, and Jane’s cousin runs Visconti’s restaurant there. Leavenworth has been remodeled to resemble a Bavarian mountain village and is a charming little town. We enjoyed a lunch at a local Mexican restaurant (Yes, I know, not very Bavarian, but we just had brats for lunch on Tuesday). We visited the local fair trade store that was owned by Karen’s parents as well as the hat shop and toy shop owned by her uncle.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/076aa5d451.jpg" alt="Downtown Leavenworth"></p>
<p>Downtown was really hot, so we headed up the mountain to take a hike along the Icicle river. The snow melt is fast and furious in the mountains so the rivers are really flowing.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/bc9e852f74.jpg" alt="Wild Rapids"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/5409012594.jpg" alt="Great to visit friends in Washington!"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/d429c22e4b.jpg" alt="Not a selfie!"></p>
<p>Although the water was very cold and the temperatures up on the mountain were much cooler we were still all pretty hot and tired after the hike. So we showed up for our reservation an hour early. No problem we enjoyed some more local wine and eventually ordered our meal.</p>
<p>Karen was going to spend a couple of days with her parents, helping out around the house, so we dropped her off before making the hour long trek back to the campground. By then we were tired so we just spent some time picking up the campsite and preparing for our morning departure.</p>
<p>The campsite was very tight, and in addition, there was a car parked right across from our site, making our exit very narrow. after getting the trailer hooked up Jane nearly had us out of the site except for the large rock blocking the corner of our site. I had tried to move it earlier in the morning in preparation for our exit but couldn’t move it. Luckily there was a burly young man doing his dishes at the water faucet on the edge of our site who said “I can move that rock for you”. together we rolled it over and we were able to get the camper out. Our next move was to wake up the tenters that owned the parked car and ask them to move it. Thankfully that was not needed.</p>

			 <p>The North Cascades (America’s Alps) is a beautiful stop on our journey. Not to mention the warmest temperatures (72 degrees) since Indio! It is also Memorial Day weekend, and the place is a zoo! Cars are everywhere, people are everywhere. Its almost as if friends and families have been freed from a pandemic and are now happily gathering together again after more than a year of quarantine and social distance.</p>
<p>Case in point, our camping neighbors, with double the allowable tents on their campsite, two dogs (Luna and Lance) and countless children. My guess from looking at all of them on the trail is that they are all young tech workers who have made the trek to the National Park to enjoy a holiday together. I really wanted to poll everyone who passed us on the trail “Computer Science degree?”</p>
<p>After arriving and getting the camper situated we decided to hike the Thunder Knob Trail. The info Jane had on the trail said it was 425 feet of elevation gain. The park brochure said 625 feet, but my feet and legs were claiming even more! We had about a quarter of the trek up left to go when a pair of young girls skipped past us and announced “You have a LONG way to go to get to the top!”. Thanks for killing my spirit I muttered. It would not be a proper vacation without at least one hiking turning out to be way more challenging than you thought.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/6d4a2b2c78.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Nevertheless it was a spectacular view of Diablo Lake. The kind of place you could just sit and contemplate the beauty of nature, and remind yourself that there is a lot of good in our country.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/e4beedf246.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It was a perfect night for a campfire🔥 unfortunately we were lacking 🪵 🪵 The National Park prohibits gathering 🪵 as well as the sale of 🪵. We should have bought 🪵 in Marblemount from one of the friendly people on the side of the road! We made due with what our predecessors had left us in the fire ring and a little bit of kindling that was laying next to the 🔥 pit. The leftovers consisted of three large 🪵 that refused to really burn. Jane did her best to whittle down the 🪵 into smaller chunks but really only made more kindling. We managed to enjoy it all for a couple of hours anyway.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/412f64e0b7.jpg" alt="Jane making some Firewood"></p>
<p>This morning we had many options! Jane had a very long list of hikes we could do. We decided to head for the furthest one called Blue Lake. Alas when we arrived at the trailhead the lot was still under many feet of snow. We hiked through the lot and attempted to find the trail itself, which did not look at all inviting.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/87470615a0.jpg" alt="The Blue Lake Lot is closed"></p>
<p>OK, for plan B we drove back toward camp thinking we would stop at Rainy Lake. It looked snowy as well, but the sheet we got from the ranger said that it was “A wheelchair-accessible paved trail to a mountain lake” How hard could it be? Our first clue should have been the couple and their dogs on skis! It turns out that when a wheelchair-accessible trail is under anywhere from 5 to 20 feet of snow it makes for a lot of ups and downs! Lots of slippery climbs and feet sinking six inches into the snow! In short, it was a snowy adventure (in shorts!) just trying to figure out where the trail was.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/73c29e5480.jpg" alt="Works for me&hellip;"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/47c93d3ba2.jpg" alt="Is this the trail??"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/71a9b28f29.jpg" alt="This is a good sign!"></p>
<p>If Jane hadn’t downloaded the trail on her All-Trails app we would never have found the lake! We would trek a ways forward then stop and consult the map. inevitably we were off to one side or the other of the official trail. We were completely by ourselves, and I immediately thought about the warnings that there were bears and rattlesnakes about. Well, I was not worried about rattlesnakes! I wasn’t really worried about 🐻 either but the thought did cross my mind.</p>
<p>After all of our work to get to the lake it was definitely worth it, all the more so because there were only a few people there. A real contrast to the campground!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/58df59105e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>By the time we finished the hike Jane’s feet were soaked! We were both way more worn out than anyone would ever imagine after a simple two mile hike on a wheelchair-accessible trail 😂 On the way back to the campground we discussed our options. Jane had made a second reservation for tonight at Pearrygin State Park, in case it was too cold in the National Park. Its not cold, but we decided that we might as well make another 60 miles of progress this afternoon as another hike was not in the cards. Who knows how busy this campground will be but we might as well find out.</p>
<p>It turned out great! We have a great site right next to the lake, and it was a beautiful night to grill some steaks and enjoy a campfire. This time we stopped and supported the “neighborhood kids” outside of Winthrop by purchasing several bundles of 🪵 for our upcoming 🔥.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday was laundry day and hang around the park day. Jane headed into Oak Harbor to wash a load of clothes while I stayed at the camper to catch up on a some emails and Runestone issues. She brought me donuts.</p>
<p>To work off the donuts we decided to do a nice long hike to the bridge and up to the summit. It was a great hike and a good chance to break in my new hiking boots. I don’t like them as much as the Salomon’s so I think there will be another trip to REI when we get back to Minnesota.</p>
<p>Here is a view of the bridge from the north beach. One fun fact about this bridge is that it was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps between 1934 and 35, one year to build the bridge! It has been a two year project just to repaint the bridge in 2020/21! I’m not sure I’d call that progress.</p>

			 <p>This morning we woke up to a bit of broken sunshine at our campground. The water was as smooth as glass. A bit of rain left over from last night was dripping down on the top of the camper. We got packed up and headed out to Port Townsend to catch the ferry to Whidbey Island. When we arrived the man working the booth warned us that due to high winds and the tides today there was a pretty strong chance that our ferry would not run as scheduled. A quick check of the weather app confirmed that the high winds were due to get worse as the day progressed. Sure enough as the time to board came closer the announcement came that the ferry would not run. A quick consultation with the man working the booth advised us that Kingston was not having any of these problems and that we should head there as the next ferry was also likely to be cancelled.</p>
<p>So, here we are at the Kingston Ferry waiting our turn to load. As we wait I noticed a ferry worker measuring the clearance of all of the campers. Jane had read that at low tide there can be an issue with getting on and off the ferry if you don’t have enough clearance. But, we are safely on the ferry now ready for the trip across. When we arrive in Edmonds we will take advantage of our new drive to stop at REI to exchange my defective hiking boots, then hit Costco to refill the tank and finally head to our campground. What should have been just an 80 mile day is turning into 160 mile day. The campsite was a bit of a challenge to get into and get the camper level, but we are getting quite good at it now.</p>

<p>For dinner we had a real treat! We met Jane’s cousin Jeff and his wife Barb, whom we met a few years ago in Seattle, and another cousin David and wife Mary for supper tonight at Nell Thorn’s Waterfront Bistro in the nearby town of La Conner. Yum!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/2f9cba1105.jpg" alt="The Waterfront in La Conner"></p>
<p>I had a delicious crab pasta, but my favorite was the crispy polenta with gorgonzola sauce! It might be the richest thing I’ve had to eat in a year. We had a wonderful dinner and great conversation. We also learned that another of Jane’s cousins owns a restaurant in Leavenworth called Viscontis. I hope we get the chance to try it as the reviews and food look very good!</p>

<p>On the way back we were treated to a bit of rain and a beautiful sunset.</p>

			 <p>This morning we went through all the weather in about 30 minutes! We started out at our Salt Creek campsite, where the forecast was for 60 and overcast most of the day. But as we climbed toward Hurricane Ridge we got into the low clouds and rain. The temperature was dropping quickly as we went up, but then we emerged from the cloud into beautiful bright blue sunshine and we had the joy of looking down at the top of the clouds!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/89eaae664f.jpg" alt="Looking down on the clouds"></p>
<p>In our fun quest to retrace our steps were trying to find the place where we took a couple of pictures on Hurricane Ridge. I apologize for the short shorts! It was the 80’s after all.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/fa9e141300.jpg" alt="Hurricane Ridge Visitors Center 1986"></p>
<p>Here are today’s photos:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/59e281f653.jpg" alt="A little cooler in May 2021 than June 1986"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/f1efdcf363.jpg" alt="We should’a sat down"></p>
<p>We did a little more hiking to enjoy the spectacular views!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/bb54e35c96.jpg" alt="Hurricane Ridge"></p>
<p>Then we were off to find Marymere falls!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/d954c006b8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I’m not sure who took the photo in 1986, but they managed to make it a little blurry. This time it was very sweet. We were getting ready to do a selfie at the falls when the young couple behind us asked if we wanted them to take our picture. Sure, I said, we are trying to recreate this photo from 35 years ago I said. It is from our honeymoon, Jane added. This young couple had just gotten engaged. So they took our picture and added that 35 years was a long time and certainly something to aspire to. Oh my.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/b319133824.jpg" alt="Marymere Falls 2021 — Good luck to the young couple that took our picture!"></p>
<p>As we were headed back down the trail, I noticed that the bridge we had just crossed looked pretty familiar. It is the bridge below.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/9557aba4ad.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>With my darker clothes it was impossible to even see me, when zoomed out. So here is a slightly zoomed in version of the same picture.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/3ac9afc382.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And last but not least, here is Jane crawling through the tree. As John Carlis used to say, never let the facts get in the way of a good story, so we are going to say that this is the exact same tree, with 35 years of growth and reshaping of the hole!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/761739b195.jpg" alt="Tree Crawling"></p>
<p>The opening has changed, but Jane’s sense of adventure is still the same as it always has been!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/840379f5ee.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Ok, here ends the nostalgic photos from 1986. We have had a blast the last two days trying to find the right spot and angle. It is amazing how similar some things are and how much some things have changed! Ruby Beach is nearly identical to what it looked like 35 years ago. The moss covered log at Marymere is nearly identical! Yet the branch that was sticking out and up is gone with no sign of it.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we leave the peninsula and take a ferry to Whidbey Island!</p>

			 <p>The plan had been to bike around crater lake. Then we learned that the road was not open yet. Although it is May 22nd, they had not yet opened the rim road due to heavy snowfall this year. The Rim hike was also closed due to snow, so we ended up walking the part of the road that was open to hikers — Discovery Point to the Wizard Island Overlook.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/e2c562e3f3.jpg" alt="Wizard Island"></p>
<p>It was cold! We are not used to temperatures in the 30’s! I personally did not pack well for this trip. I usually bring way too many cold weather clothes and not enough warm weather. But this trip is the opposite. So I have on my biking base layer, a long sleeve T shirt, a vest, a sweatshirt, and my rain jacket! After our hike we did stop at the gift shop and I scored a nice wool camping shirt. That will help, but I think I’m going to miss my puffy jacket.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/91d91f4332.jpg" alt="Bundled up for cool weather"></p>
<p>We did enjoy some great sights on our two mile hike.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/7e69cc0686.jpg" alt="Still lots of snow to melt"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/57ea437bff.jpg" alt="Crater Lake"></p>
<p>After our Crater Lake hiking we stopped at Beckies for lunch. Its amazing how smells bring back memories. Sitting outside this walkup restaurant waiting for my burger I was transported back to the drive-in in Storden Minnesota. Yeah, its just hot grease, but still.</p>
<p>On the way back to the campground there were two more opportunities to see the beauty of the Rogue River.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/03c496ac75.jpg" alt="Rogue River"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/3228055414.jpg" alt="Underground river outlet"></p>
<p>Meanwhile, back at the campground, the plan was to make some soup for supper in the instant pot. But it seems that the electrical cord has gone missing! Another stop at Wal-Mart or best buy I guess&hellip;. I don’t know where it could have gone as it has never really left the camper, and I’ve used it at least once before. But we looked everywhere, and by we I mean both Jane and I so it wasn’t just “man looking”</p>
<p>Tomorrow we have a fairly long day heading North to Cascade Locks.</p>

			 <p>8:00 This morning we are getting an early start and I’ve decided to record this in real time, or at least near real time. We have another 50 miles on Highway 1, so more slow going on twisty winding roads. I’m writing this as we go today. We have left the coast and are amongst the redwoods. The road is super narrow but lined with trees, its just beautiful the way the sunlight filters through creating shadows all around us. There are few turnouts , so no real opportunities for taking photos.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/e8063b118c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>9:25 still a few more miles to go before we get to the 101.</p>
<p>9:39 Just saw our first advertisement for the “Drive Through Tree”! We will not fit, but hopefully we will see it.</p>
<p>9:45 We are on the 101, but a sign advises us that there are sharp curves for the next 9 miles and we are advised to slow down. 😜. Lots of tourist traps for “tree houses” and Confusion Hill House, and the “one log cabin!” An entire log house made out of a single log. It looks like more of a hobbit house or a culvert with a door, but whatever.</p>
<p>9:52 We are on the freeway, at least for a short time&hellip;</p>
<p>10:03 - the legend of bigfoot! complete with three highway patrol officers with their lights flashing. I guess we will not stop to buy any bigfoot souveniers.</p>
<p>10:20 We are now on the Avenue of the Giants. We are heading for Founders Grove to make a stop and enjoy the Redwoods for a bit. Some of the Redwoods in founders grove are over 350 feet tall!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/f8aa38a1fb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Lots of pictures looking straight up today!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/d606cf90dc.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>11:08 Just finished the nature walk at the visitor center. Amazing! There is no way our pictures are going to capture the size and beauty of these trees!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/57f2f21e10.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/9fa187736f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>12:00 Just finished our walk at Founders Grove! Amazing, Amazing, Amazing. The Founders tree is 349 feet tall! More than a soccer pitch! The diameter is over 12 feet and the circumference just over 40</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/f023e3618b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/9f71fdfe43.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>12:10 pull over by some big trees for a picnic lunch along side the road. A most picturesque lunch spot!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/7ab7dd1f55.jpg" alt="Roadside lunch stop"></p>
<p>12:24 back on the road — 2:17 minutes left to our destination. The rest of the day will be on Hwy 101.</p>
<p>1:30 Gas stop in Eureka! Last stop before our campsite&hellip;</p>
<p>2:25 Arrived - Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park</p>
<p>2:45 We have determined that our campsite and our camper are incompatible. The site is steep and it is impossible to get our camper anywhere near level. Jane seeks out the Ranger to see if there are any cancellations.</p>
<p>3:00 they have two possibilities for us. After a little walk around the campground we determine that one is super small, and level, but there would be no room for the truck. Luckily the other will work great for one night. Its a bit exposed with the slide hanging right out to the road. But most sites near us are already occupied so we don’t expect much traffic.</p>
<p>3:45 we are finally in our campsite with the trailer leveled up and the solar panels plugged in.</p>
<p>4:00 we take off for a hike, having abandoned the idea of a 20 mile bike ride.</p>
<p>4:20 we arrive at Fern Canyon for our hike. It is for the best that we didn’t try to ride our bikes here after all. Its a steep one lane road with the barest of turnouts for when you meet someone. Thankfully the hike makes it all worth while. Fern canyon is a coastal bluff left behind by the retreating oceans years ago. The steep walls of the bluffs are covered with ferns, and the little steam running down the middle makes for a beautiful hike. Again the pictures surely do not do it justice.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/ef52250e04.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/be65b1db4b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>5:25 depart Fern Canyon for Lady Bird Johnson Grove. This is completely different than Founders Grove as it is higher in elevation, on a ridge top where the winds challenge the trees all the time. Its great that this is named after Lady Bird Johnson, who fell in love with this grove when she came to dedicate Redwoods National Park in 1968, but it is pretty humbling to consider that when many of these trees have been here for 1,000 years!</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/3bb370d6c1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>7:00 Back at the campsite! Time to make some dinner and relax. Tomorrow we head to Crater Lake where we will stay for two nights.</p>

			 <p>This morning began with Coffee and a quick, but promising, Zoom meeting with the folks from ProjectSTEM.org, about how Runestone and ProjectSTEM can work together. After that energizing call I quickly transitioned to camper loading mode, before heading out for our final nine holes of golf with the couples league at 9AM. In the meantime the guys showed up to start laying the Pavers <img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/427ad36144.jpg" alt="Sidewalk Gone, Pavers are in!"> in our new courtyard area! Talk about a busy last day in the desert!</p>
<p>Our latest journey will take us up the california coast following Highway 1 and 101, through Oregon and into Washington state where we will retrace the steps of our honeymoon from 34 years 11 months ago! We’ll call it 35 years. when we finish our visit to the Olympic Peninsula we’ll head east and meet our friends Jim and Karen in Chelan Washington, and then make a beeline for Minnesota across the barren north! We are looking forward to 3 weeks of beautiful scenery, eating seafood <strong>out</strong>, hiking, biking and our little camper.</p>
<p>We are now experiencing LA traffic, sitting on the <a href="https://youtu.be/5Ha-ZsGxCb8" title="Ventura Highway">Ventura HIghway</a>, going slow., the free wind is not blowing through our hair as we have the AC on. We also haven’t been hit by any purple rain, so we got that going for us. Only 98 miles to go to our campsite but the estimated time of arrival keeps holding steady so I guess all this traffic was anticipated. I’m happy to report that the temperature here on the 101 is a good 20 degrees cooler than when we left Indio just a few hours ago. That is down 20 degrees from 100!</p>
<p>We are now happily in our campsite at El Capitan State Beach! It is only 65 degrees here so its starting to feel like Minnesota, but we are so happy to be on the road and are already enjoying this new adventure! <img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/88b7d2abd3.jpg" alt="Our Campsite">We got the camper set up and went for a short hike! <img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/821aba6061.jpg" alt="Our ocean view!"> Next up happy hour, dinner, and then some rest after a very busy day.</p>

<p>I never thought of myself as a Snowbird, but even with COVID-19, our second Winter in Indio is amazing! In college we used to joke about getting condos in the same building when we got old, so we could party together every night and have fun after we had worked hard and raised kids and … But who knew that something like that would actually start to happen?</p>
<p>Here we are in our mid-50’s; living a retirement lifestyle, while still working a balanced workweek. What do I mean by that? Well here is our basic daily schedule. Of course this may vary due to visitors or other events.</p>
<ul>
<li>5:30 AM wakeup, wait 5 minutes for the water to get hot and then get out of bed and make a delicious pour over coffee to start the day. Read the news and do Sudoku or The NY Times crossword until 7:00AM</li>
<li>7:00 AM Be productive.</li>
<li>8:00 AM play pickleball — unless I have an early tee time on Monday or Friday with my wonderful TGIF group.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>10:00AM Be Productive</li>
<li>2:00 PM If it is Jan — March, take a bike ride (unless I’ve already played pickleball and golf!). If its April or May it may be too hot to ride now.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/9a55364738.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>3:00 PM — Occasionally this is happy hour time over zoom with friends back in the midwest.</li>
<li>5:00 PM almost always happy hour out here. Unless you are still on the course for a late round of golf.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2021/ef70f00450.jpg" alt=""></p>

			 <p>Today was a rough day. The hills were steep, the good people of Galena seem to hate bikers, and I was chased by a goat.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/d01fb837f0.png" alt="View of our campsite right along the Mississippi"></p>
<p>First, the hills. There were a lot of them, and some of them were steep, really steep. 16% grade on one of them steep. This makes for pretty difficult riding if I do say so myself. Overall, today was not very scenic and it was all on roads, sometimes with shoulders and sometimes not.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ab13d1de43.png" alt="Hills, here there and everywhere"></p>
<p>The people of Galena. So here is the thing, coming into Galena there is no shoulder on the road so I have to ride in the lane. People are in a hurry so rather than waiting to pass me when there is no oncoming traffic as one would do when passing a car, people decide to crowd the center line and see if they can’t get by. This creates a situation that is extremely dangerous for the guy on the bike! The roads are filled with cracks and other obstacles that cause us to swerve that drivers of cars don’t even notice. when you only give me a foot of riding space that is not much room to maneuver.</p>
<p>My strategy is to simply claim the lane, which of course does not win me any new friends. I’ll move over when it is safe for them to pass. Really it is not that much time out of your day to wait for the oncoming traffic to pass so that you can pass me like any other vehicle. And it sure as heck will save you a lot of messy time explaining to the police why you caused an accident.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1030e4523c.png" alt="Why is that pine tree leaning toward the picnic table?"></p>
<p>The goat…. What can I say, I was just coming up a hill, admiring the Halloween decorations at yet another country store, when all of the sudden this big goat comes at me. Where did he come from!?? I guess he escaped his pen, or maybe he was put there to guard the pumpkins? I wish I had our little episode on camera but his horns looked quite nasty so I didn’t hang around to get that Kodak moment!</p>
<p>Despite all of the annoyances, I made it safely to our campground at Mississippi Palisades. The park is huge and our campsite was way back away from everything. We grilled some pork chops from Fareway over an open campfire and had a good night.</p>

			 <p>This all started a year ago when the government posted a travel warning for the Playa area of Mexico where we had booked a week at an all inclusive resort.  Not wanting to take any chances we decided to switch to a cruise at the last minute and book a different resort.  This resulted in us booking at the Cofresi Palms in Puerto Plata.</p>
<p>However, coming on the heels of two very long vacations I needed to make this something of a working vacation to make sure the materials for the AC201 course were as good as possible.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p>A couple of mornings I worked in our room, which was a really nice two bedroom suite with wonderful views of the beach.  But then we discovered these covered beds right on the beach, big enough for all of us to hang out together and in the shade, with good enough WiFi for everything except video conferencing.  So I switched — can you blame me?</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2aadd49510.jpg" alt="My office"></p>
<p>Traveling with our friends Brian and Holly is always super relaxing.  Whether its hanging at the pool bar or playing cards at the beach we always have a great time.  We planned absolutely no activities for this week so it was really all about reading, and lounging, which made it easy for me to mix in some work too.</p>
<p>This was our first ever experience at an all inclusive resort, so we had very little in the way of expectations.  And mostly they were met.</p>
<p>A few things were a nice surprise.  Our room, a “penthouse suite” was very nice.  We had a living and kitchen area on the first floor with a fridge full of water, soda and beer.  We also really liked the coffee pot in the room.  The bedrooms upstairs were huge, each with its own deck and spectacular view of the resort and ocean.  Our bathroom was fine, but in serious need of updating and new grout.</p>
<p>The Mexican and the Indian restaurant.  We should have eaten all our meals at these two.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>We had read about the “men in the hats” before we arrived.  A small army of high pressure sales people that will try anything to get you into a sales pitch situation, and invest in the timeshare.  “Tours”, better breakfasts, free golf cart rides, tokens for upgrades your next time back&hellip; They really try to get you the first day, and then came at us again hard towards the end.  Dodging them became a kind of sport for us.</p>
<p>The bands.  Everyone has to wear a wristband.  These identify you and your level.  Lots of places are for VIPs only, so if you don’t have the right colored band you are not welcome.  We were not VIPs.  See the previous paragraph for another part of their sales tactics.</p>
<p>The cups.  All of our drinks came in these tiny plastic cups.  Brian referred to the beers that came in them as “beer shots”. There was one kind of beer - El Presidenté, All of the drinks were watered down, but hey what they lack in quality they made up for in quantity.</p>
<p>The service.  I feel bad writing such negative stuff, but the staff at the restaurants was really apathetic.  Sometimes we were so rushed that we could hardly enjoy our food.  Other times the service was so slow that we mostly had lost interest by the time it was served.  We did learn that a $1 tip could get you a lot of good will and even a smile.</p>
<p>The smell.  Running through the middle of the resort is a cement canal with a big sewage pipe suspended in the canal.  The pipe leaked.  The smell permeated everything downwind, which included one of the largest pool areas in the complex.</p>
<h2 id="but-we-still-had-fun">But we still had fun</h2>
<p>Although I’ve listed a lot of negatives, and that may be because I’m a snob.  But in the end we still had a lot of fun, and spent some great time reading and relaxing.  I would do an all inclusive again sometime, maybe, but it won’t be this one, and I think I have a lot of other places and things on my list.</p>

			 <p>Well it was bound to happen, and as we like to say, it could have been worse.  Landed at MSP just before 9:00 this morning.  It was 1 degree Fahrenheit (-17 C) and the snow was just starting to Fall.</p>
<p>The Galapagos cruise was unlike any other we have been on. High on the active scale, high on the learning new things every day scale, and with the small ship very high on the meet interesting people scale.  As the hotel manager John Flynn told us, they are very well aware that this cruise is a bucket list trip for most passengers, and they really do their best to make it memorable.  And that was just one component of this trip!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Amazon Rainforest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Machu Picchu and Inca trail hike</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cusco and the Sacred Valley</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Galápagos Islands</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jane and I have had so many interesting experiences on this trip that it seems like we have been gone for months, not just the three weeks.</p>
<p>We left Quito early this morning (12:30AM) and arrived in Atlanta by 5:30.  Getting through customs and making the transfer to the domestic gates was a breeze thanks to our Global Entry passes.  But neither of us ended up sleeping on that flight and we just dozed a little on the flight to Minneapolis, so we were both beat by the time we got out of the Uber in downtown Minneapolis.</p>
<p>In an attempt to wake up a bit, I went down to use the elliptical in our workout room.  As the minutes ticked away I watched the Wells Fargo building and IDS Tower disappear into the increasingly heavy snowfall.  We are supposed to get more than four inches today, and you can see that even this afternoon it is still coming down pretty heavily.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/62208435c0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As with all good trips, we learned a lot, came to appreciate new cultures, old histories, and new parts of the globe.  It’s great to get away and get a new perspective on the business of everyday life, and to evaluate one’s priorities.  But as the saying goes, there is no place like home.  We are happy to be back, and already looking forward to an exciting weekend of activities including a play at the Guthrie and a broadway series performance!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>We started our day today with a visit to the Darwin Research Center.  One of the main projects at this center is the preservation of the many different species of tortoises on the islands.  Many of which were hunted to near extinction by whalers or pushed out of their habitat by goats, dogs and cats.  The tortoise in the image below is a saddle back!  A close genetic relative of “Lonesome George” that last true Saddleback that died a few years back.  You can see that they have very long necks which is an adaptation for eating the cacti on the desert islands of the Galapagos.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/0fe1e7400e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And of course we saw many of the Galapagos Tortoise both at the Darwin center and later on in the wild.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6ef5b2b2a0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Another highlight of the day was our chance to participate in Celebrity Cruise Lines reforestation project.  Many of the native Escalesa trees were choked out by the blackberries that were imported by the settlers on the islands.  With a lot of work the blackberries have been culled, but now Celebrity is working to replant many many acres of forrest with native Escalesa trees.  To date Celebrity and their guests have planted nearly 40,000 trees, and I’m happy that we got to participate.</p>

<p>As an added bonus we all got to wear the super stylish rubber boots!</p>

			 <p>By this time of the trip the routine was well established.  Breakfast in the morning, then off to the zodiacs for an adventure / hike on shore.  Back to the ship for lunch and a rest during the worst heat of the day, then a late afternoon zodiac to another destination for another hike.  This is definitely an adventure not a vacation!  This afternoons hike was billed as the most difficult of the trip, because it involved a little rock scrabbling!  As usual a few people joined that really shouldn’t have, you would think people would learn their limitations by this time.  Anyway, after the rock scrabbling we were rewarded with a beautiful view of the beach.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2cda79872c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Along the way we saw a lot of Blue Footed Boobies, we had to leave the trail to keep our distance from them several times as they just sit in the middle of the path looking at us.  It was definitely worthwhile as this is probably one of my favorite photos of this whole adventure!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8f26d36248.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The blue footed boobies take turns on the nest, if you can call it that.  It’s barely even a hole in the ground.  Further, they don’t really even sit on the eggs, they kind of cradle them with their feet.  Here’s a picture of the “changing of the guard”</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2227239b48.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The reds are not nearly as interesting as the blues.  They are arboreal and so you rarely see them on the ground.  Their feet are red, but not bright red like the bright blue.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/0333881ba3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On the beach where we landed to start the hike was a small colony of sea lions.</p>

			 <p>The activity of the morning was a “long” walk around Dragon hill on Santa Cruz.  The main objective was to see the Land Iguanas.  These creatures have been restored to the island after they were endangered by feral dogs and goats that humans brought to the island.  Santa Cruz is one of the few islands that is actually inhabited.</p>
<p>The cover picture for this post is actually of a marine iguana that was near the shore by a brackish pool.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f7f1834e31.jpg" alt="green marine"></p>
<p>You can see a very clear difference in coloration and shape between the marine variety — which can swim using their tails for propulsion — and the land iguanas pictured below.</p>
<p>At one point they moved many of the Land Iguanas to an alternative island without any human habitation for them to come back, while they started a program to eradicate all of the goats and feral dogs.  We actually saw a goat along the way, and the guides, who are also park rangers when they are on land, had to call it in so that the goat could be tracked down and captured.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4c2f4bbc24.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>the walk started at 8:00 and already it was really hot.  We began the walk on the beach and quickly passed by this beautiful brackish water pool.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/99ee9958cf.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The path was very muddy from rain the previous night, and a few people from the group ahead of us called it quits and headed back to the beach.  But we kept going, eyes peeled for our first siteing.  The first Land Iguana we met was pretty hard to miss as he was right on the trail!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/450c458e30.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Once we spotted the first one we started to see quite a few of them.  Some close to the path, some sitting right outside their burrows, some “lounge lizards” hanging out on a log.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/96c30d00bd.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/07ec470ab1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c364b5083c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The scenery on the island was also very beautiful and couldn’t have been more different than our hike up the volcano from the day before.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/dbd29c8788.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="afternoon-snorkel">Afternoon Snorkel</h2>
<p>In the afternoon we had a beach snorkeling stop.  The water was pretty wavy and as a result the visibility was not very good.  I was right next to a big sea turtle and I could easily have grabbed onto the shell to go for a ride.  But you don’t touch the wild animals so I just followed it and admired it s grace.</p>
<p>The real highlight of the snorkeling trip was the Pelicans.  After coming back to shore there were about 3 brown pelicans that decided it was feeding time.  They are “shallow plungers” so they swoop up into the air about 15 to 20 feet and then plunge awkwardly into the water to capture a fish!  They were definitely not deterred by all of the humans in the water as several swooped right next to people!  The pelicans were fine, but the people were a bit shocked!</p>

<p>You will likely see even better photos than the one above as we were there at the wrong time of day for optimal photo lighting.</p>
<p>The hike was mostly just climbing the 366 old wooden stairs and many boardwalks to the top of the volcano where there is a great viewing and picture taking spot.  Along the way we stopped to learn a bit about volcanology, spatter cones, calderas, and craters.</p>
<p>The naturalists on board are all great and really knowledgeable.  Most, if not all, of them were born on the islands and you can tell they all really love it.</p>

			 <p>Looking out the window in the morning we couldn’t see anything.  Had our luck changed?  Were we going to have a rainy day after all?  I went up on deck to investigate and was happy to see that it was just a dense fog.  Caused by the cold water currents running up against the Galapagos ridge.  It would burn off.  All credit to Ann who insisted that we take the 10:00 excursion rather than the 8:00 excursion.  This is what the fog looked like just before we boarded our zodiac at 10.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bcfd94f4da.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We later learned that it was so foggy during the 8:00 trip that one of the zodiacs took a wrong turn in all of the mangrove and got lost for a bit.  Apparently everyone was taking it in stride and singing the theme song to Gillian’s island (except for one passenger who was not amused). I almost wish I was on that boat so I could tell the story in more detail.  Here you can just barely make out our ship in the fog from a distance.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5c8ce6200f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We were headed into a huge lagoon protected by mangroves but on the way we got some good sitings of a few of the marine birds.  Below is the famous Blue Footed Boobie.  Yes, I kind of giggle inside like a seventh grader every time I say that.  The reality is that the name comes from the fact that they act like clowns during their mating dance.  Kicking their legs up and flapping their wings and acting like fools.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2e27285da3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We also got very close to a few brown pelicans.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/eb805ec318.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And we saw the Galapagos Penguin!  The second smallest penguin in the world.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/86334688e8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>They look kind of dopey and slow when they are out of the water but when they are in the water they swim fast and graceful.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/32bdb78f53.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We saw turtles all over the place poking their heads out of the water, but it was not until the afternoon when we did our deep water snorkel that we really got to have a great view of the turtles.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1b7a7ff6b1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Toward the end of the trip we were way back amongst the mangroves and we saw a sea lion sleeping on a branch just a few feet above the water.  We also had a very close encounter with a Great Blue Heron</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8314a61e70.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We were also lucky enough to see some golden rays swimming just beneath us. Too bad that we were not able to capture them on camera.</p>
<h2 id="hike-at-tagus-bay">Hike at Tagus Bay</h2>
<p>The afternoon was in Tagus bay where we started with a drift snorkel. It was great, we saw a lot of sea turtles, and fish, but the most amazing was when I got to watch one of the penguins swimming underwater.</p>
<p>After we dried off from the snorkel trip we headed out for the “fitness hike” This was billed as a faster paced walk with fewer stops but the same great scenery.  With people of all different ages on the cruise the walks tend to go at the pace of the slowest person in the group so we thought this would be a good option.  And it was.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7ef211c7f0.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We climbed 150 stairs and then walked a bit to have a great view of the bay and this highly salty inland lake.</p>
<p>After a mile we came to the end of the trail where we could see the difference between the two sides of the volcano we were climbing.  We were climbing the wet side and were suddenly treated to a huge vista of the dry side.  You could images that you had just landed on mars!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2ec72d6be8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We took another short zodiac ride to view the geology of the volcano and some of the wildlife.  Here you can see the layers where the older layers have oxidized!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2e5ce39c2e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After we got back on the ship we had time to relax with a happy hour drink and enjoy the amazing sunset.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cbb6cff2d2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Up next was a delicious dinner where we watched one of our exhausted fellow passengers fall asleep right at her table with conversation and laughter going on all around her.</p>
<p>After dinner there was a small party to celebrate crossing the equator on our way around the north end of Isabella island.  We were all encouraged to do the limbo and imitate one of our favorite Galapagos animals.  As a group we did the blue footed boobie dance, and narrowly lost the contest to a couple imitating sea lions.</p>

			 <p>Iguanas fighting over territory, thousands of crabs, two species of sea lions, lizards galore, birds and even a snake; this is what we saw on our first day in the Galápagos!</p>
<p>Today was a good practice day as we all learned about “wet landings” and “dry landings” in the Zodiacs we use to transfer from the ship to the shore.  We go in groups of up to sixteen people along with a naturalist that will take us on our hike once on shore.  It’s a bit of a process this first day to get off the zodiac in the water, then change shoes in the hot sand, but we are getting the hang of it.</p>
<p>We hiked for about 90 minutes and saw a lot of amazing animals&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/96d27066a3.jpg" alt="baby sealion"></p>
<p>When we first came ashore, we saw this baby sea lion just hanging out on the rock.  Very cute.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2de6232b86.jpg" alt="Lizard"></p>
<p>The next thing we noticed was the lizards.  They were everywhere and you had to be careful as you were walking so that you didn’t step on them!  They are cold blooded so at this time of the morning they were all out on the warm sand bringing up their body temperatures.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9489e27618.jpg" alt="birds"></p>
<p>Of course the Galapagos are home to many many birds, and they have no fear of humans, very few of the animals on the islands do!  But this one takes the cake as it landed on Ann’s hat.  The guide told us that they really like cameras with big lenses and that they will use them like a mirror to admire themselves.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/22b72b353d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After hiking the inland part of the trail we started to walk the shoreline.  Our first site was the sealions.  They are nocturnal, so they were just floating in the cool waters and resting during the day.  Looks like a pretty good life to me.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e3e25307d5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The shoreline was just full of these red crabs, called “sally light foot crabs”.  Here you can also see one of the many iguanas looking at them. The iguanas eat algae so its not hunting them.  The Oyster catcher birds, do hunt the crabs, and we saw some of those as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1795112ce2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And here is the king of the iguanas!  Looks like he is in charge to me!</p>
<h2 id="rabida-island">Rabida Island</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/d945763004.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the afternoon we headed to Rabida island for some more hiking and snorkeling.  Here we are in all of our orange splendor.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8b2b2e6533.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cffa257496.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The hike was hot but really beautiful.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6804f4a580.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I just loved how the prickly pear cacti just grow right out of the lava rock on this island.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4e380d664e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is a brackish lake.  Much of the water comes from rain and runoff from the hill behind, but at high tide, some water can flow over the mangrove berm and into the lake as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1defe8fc80.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And this is the frigate bird.  They are amazing in that they steal food from other birds right out of the air!  They also love to float and glide alongside and above the ship as we slowly reposition ourselves.</p>

			 <p>It turns out that Ecuador is a great place to study the equator.  It’s not in the middle of a jungle, but runs close to Quito with lots of varying terrain.  They thought that they had the equator nailed, but then along came GPS and they found out there were off by about 200 meters.  Now at the new and improved site we got to explore some of the common, cool things you hear about our hemispheres.</p>
<p>We did the water test.  Yes, when the sink is directly on the equator the water goes straight down the drain.  Moving it ten feet to the south the water makes a vortex going clockwise.  When you move the sink 10 feet to the north the water drains counterclockwise!  This is supposed to demonstrate the Coriolis effect, but I’m skeptical (and so are lots of other folks) that the effect would really be that different just a few feet either side of the equator.</p>
<p>We balanced an egg on the head of a nail.  It was a bit windy and tricky to get right, but in the end both Jane and I accomplished the task.</p>
<p>We saw the sundial telling us the “true time”. It was about 20 minutes off from my watch.</p>
<p>And we did a strength test.  This seems to be the most controversial and unexplained of all of the equator tests we did.  Standing a few feet off the equator you can resist quite well someone pulling down on your arms.  But standing directly on the equator line you seem to lose all your strength.  Other than psychological explanations for this I haven’t found a physics based reason for why this is true.</p>
<p>In the moment it doesn’t matter whether any of these things are true or not, it was a good and fun way to spend our afternoon.</p>

			 <p>After a morning with Chef Jose you will definitely believe that Peru is the center of the culinary universe, and has been for thousands of years.  Did you know&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/d97a38145d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All tomatoes in the world originated in Peru?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All potatoes in the world originated in Peru?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peru has been the top culinary destination in the world for several years running?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are thousands of varieties of potatoes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are at least 3 different varieties of passion fruit?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Chef Jose picked us up at our hotel, and walked us the few blocks to his restaurant/culinary school.  We started out with a fruit quiz.  We actually got the first 4 of nine correct.  Jose said we did way better than most.</p>
<p>After the quiz we tasted each of the fruits.  Yes, me, I tasted all of them.  Truthfully I liked most of them, except the one that looked and had the same texture as an avocado!  The quiz didn’t include any banana or plantain as I had already told the chef I couldn’t eat them.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6678bac3e8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the meantime, every few minutes someone would come in with a new appetizer for us to taste.  Crunchy bruschetta and shrimp with Peruvian cheese melted on top. Delicious.</p>
<p>After the fruit tasting we went into the next room where we were introduced to many different ingredients used in Peruvian cooking.  We learned about many different types of Quinoa, which has become so popular around the world that Peruvians have had to look for alternatives because its become so expensive in Peru!</p>
<p>Next up was a bit of mixology.  We learned how to make the traditional Pisco Sour and another drink called a Chilcano.  It was too sweet for both of us, so we decided to stick with the Pisco Sour.  Which we took with us into the kitchen where we started on our first dish of the day.  Ceviche — “Made with Love”. We learned not to trust any ceviche that is made and allowed to sit more than a few minutes before serving.  Of course this means you need to make certain that your fish is absolutely fresh and perfect before you start.</p>
<p>Our ceviche was served with crunchy corn kernels and small cubes of sweet potato.  Peruvian chefs love to play with combinations of flavors and textures and this combination definitely allowed for that!  It was great, sweet potatoes are even tolerable if you have enough ceviche sauce on them!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6c7660fe3b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After enjoying our ceviche and a little of our Pisco Sour we moved on to our second dish.  A classic in Peru, called Lomo Saltado.  It combines the wok cooking that influenced Peruvian chefs years ago with crunchy French fries and the rice that is so prevalent in Peruvian cooking.  Like many Asian dishes this one cooks very quickly in a very hot wok once you get everything prepped.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f61c84fcc4.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>When we finished the dish we took it outside and ate it all under an umbrella along with our Pisco Sour drinks.  It was great and definitely something I’ll try to replicate back home.</p>
<p>This was a great culinary experience and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Cusco and looking to learn a bit more about Peruvian history and culture through the food!</p>

<p>OK, if you say the above title out loud a few times you will know that I had to include that in this post. — Not getting it?  Then think Sexy Woman.  No, its not a risqué statue in the middle of Cusco it is another huge Incan structure on one of the many hills surrounding Cusco.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9a59839254.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The walk around the Saqsay Waman site was also our first chance to get up close to a Llama (pronounced Yama by the locals)</p>

			 <p>It rained hard all night long, and it was still very cloudy when we got up for breakfast.  But, by the time Fernando picked us up to go to the bus, the sun was shining and it looked like we were going to have great weather for our visit.</p>
<p>After seeing Machu Picchu from the Sun Gate I wasn’t sure what was left.  Plenty, as it turns out.  It was just amazing to walk with our guide through this huge complex and marvel at the design and engineering.  For everything you see above ground there is also underground engineering work to create the drainage system that has kept Machu Picchu stable all of these years.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bab6019015.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>One of the biggest threats to Machu Picchu is the number of humans that visit each year.  It wasn’t designed to handle that kind of traffic!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7a9191a205.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Machu Picchu was never finished, due to the Spanish invasion, but nevertheless many people lived there over the five generations it took to get it to what we see.  During that time there was even much rebuilding as priests died and new priests took their place and wanted to change or move the various temples.</p>
<p>You can see several different levels of workmanship.  From the super high quality at some of the lower layers and in the places where the important people lived to the lesser quality near the top as they rushed to finish, or simply didn’t care to do the same quality of workmanship for the new Spanish conquerors.</p>
<p>After a morning of wandering around, we had a delicious lunch at the restaurant right in the national park.  Then headed down to Agua Caliente where it started to pour rain again.  We hung out in the market for a while then headed to the hotel, where we met up with Bob and Bonni and sat by the fire until it was time to board our train to take us back to Cusco.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://reputablejournal.com/2019/01/21/160000.html">You never know who you will meet on the Inca Trail</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I woke up around 3:30AM when I heard a few splatters of rain against the roof of our Casita.  The alarm was set to go off at 5AM, groaning internally I rolled over and listened to the rain turn from splatters to a steady stream.  Our goal for the day was to do the 7.5 mile Inca Trail hike to the Sun Gate of Machu Picchu.  I really was not looking forward to doing that in the rain!</p>
<p>After much tossing and turning 5:00 finally came and we headed up for an early breakfast.  We were meeting our guide and driver at 6:00 to head to the train for the trip to our drop off point.  At breakfast we met Bob and Bonni who were taking the same train, but going all the way to Agua Caliente and visiting Machu Picchu from there.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the lobby to meet our guide, Bonni was on the phone with their guide.  It seems that there was a big accident on the way from Cusco and that their driver was going to be at last 30 minutes late, which would cause them to miss the train.  We volunteered to ask our guide to see if they could ride with us rather than riding in the taxi and everything worked out great.</p>
<p>About halfway to the drop off point the rain stopped!  By the time we were ready to hit the trail we could actually see a few patches of blue sky peeking through the clouds.  This was looking like a good day for hiking after all!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5609b64275.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The one day hike has three main parts.  The first half is up hill where we gained over 1500 feet of elevation.  The next section is billed as being pretty flat, but that’s a lie.  It’s flat until the end where you have to climb up to the Sun gate.  From the Sun gate its all downhill, but that is maybe the last 1/8 of the 7.5 mile hike.</p>
<p>We took it at a good pace and enjoyed most of the climb.  The scenery got better and better as we climbed higher.  We were mostly alone on the trail.  There was another pair of hikers that started just a bit before we did, and every so often we could catch sight of a larger group of 9 ahead of us on the trail.</p>
<p>Soon we were high enough to look down on the trains as they passed with passengers heading to Agua Caliente.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7688cfa34d.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>One of the sites we got to see along our hike was the amazing Wiñay Wayra terraces.  It was beautiful to see from the distance.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/951f9765bb.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We thought it looked close, but somehow we kept walking and it never seemed to get any closer.  Finally we came down a few stairs then up a few stairs and stopped for a rest at the base of a waterfall. This was our time to gather our energy for the climb through Wiñay Wayra.  When we arrived the group of nine was just leaving, so we felt like we were doing a good job of keeping the pace.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f99a17158f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>It looks a lot more daunting in person than it does in this photo.  And when we finally got to the base I started counting stairs. We were able to do about 60 at a time then we would have to stop and rest and catch our breath.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cf27962d9b.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The altitude definitely makes it harder work!  After 375 stairs we finally arrived at the terrace about 2/3 of the way up where we were able to go across and exit.  This was an amazing place for a picture.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1b80d92e43.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This was basically the end of the uphill part.  Both of us were extremely happy about that.  The next couple of hours were pretty easy and we made good time.  At some point along the way we even passed the larger group, saying our cheerful hellos as we passed.</p>
<p>The first big surprise of the afternoon came when I came around a corner and in the middle of the bridge ahead of me was a Spectacle Bear! It saw me and quickly headed the other direction, while I fumbled to try to unclip my camera.  It moved off the path but Fernando advised us to just be quiet and wait.  Soon we saw it again climbing across the limb of the tree.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/72dc5d4753.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Our guide had told us about the bear earlier, and we knew that it is one of two bears in the world that are vegetarian.  He also said that this was only the second time in 25 years that he had seen one up close like this.</p>
<p>A bit further along we arrived at the first part of the trail where we started to climb toward the Sun Gate.  Then we walked some more and came to the second part of the ascent, and then we arrived at the really hard part.  You can get a good idea of how steep this was and a view of my best side.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/dc42b23f24.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We thought we would be there but we still had 10 more minutes of walking and another bunch of stairs yet!  But when we finally got to the end it was so worth it!  And we had the view all to ourselves.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9d8fad126a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After taking in the view, we moved off to the side where we could site on a nice ledge and have a snack and continue to enjoy the view.  At this point the group of nine, that we had passed at some point during the day, came through the Sun Gate as well.  We exchanged greetings and discovered that the group was from Minnesota and Iowa.  This led to what part of Minnesota, what part of Iowa questions etc.  When I said that we had recently moved to Minneapolis from Decorah, I heard a voice say “Brad!?” And this was the second big surprise of the day.  Sure enough two of the People in this group were Kurt and Paula Meyer, fellow Luther alumnus and Paula had also been chair of the board of Regents when I served as faculty representative!  Amazing!!  Four Luther alums on the Inca Trail arriving at the Sun Gate within minutes of each other.  What are the chances?  Sounds like a data science question.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f987061642.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We discovered that we were staying at the same hotel that night, so we said our temporary good byes and we all headed down the final part of the trail.  Along the way down we had our third big surprise.  Jane was using her hiking poles and poked a viper.  Our guide advised us to hurry on by and not pause to take any pictures of the poison snake.  So we did.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the bottom we still had to take a bus further down the mountain to Agua Caliente and then a short walk to our hotel, the Inkaterra.  At checkin we had the option of the 6:00 or the 8:00 seating for dinner.  We thought that maybe a dip in the hot springs (Agua Caliente) would be a good way to relax and rest up for the 8:00 dinner.  But by the time we had our complimentary Pisco Sour and chatted about our day with bob and Bonni, we decided that we didn’t have the energy to make it until 8:00.  So we switched to the 6:00 seating and we are so glad we did.  We were so tired and sore from our day of hiking that we were laying in bed reading by 8:00!</p>
<p>Tomorrow we go back to Machu Picchu to get an up close look!</p>

			 <p>The flight from Puerto Moldenado was blissfully short.  It was almost comical how many first time fliers seemed to be on our plane.  When we left the runway there were gasps of joy and cheers all over the plane.  There were also a lot of children making a lot of noise.  Jeez I sound like some cranky old man!  But we had barely leveled off before we were getting ready to land again.  It was a 40 minute flight but according to Maps a 9 hour drive!</p>
<p>We were met by our friendly guide Fernando who will be with us for our time around Cusco.  He had water waiting for us — Hydration is important at altitude as well as a nice hot cup of Coca tea.  Also good for helping you get acclimated.  Today we were just going to see a bit of the Sacred Valley, a local market and have a bite to eat before checking in to our hotel — Luna y Sol.</p>
<p>The picture below shows the spectacular view of one of the many valleys we saw.  The whole base of the valley is filled with CORN FIELDS.  They have a huge variety of corn, purple, yellow, red, white and other colors, and the kernels are the size of marbles.  It a very important part of the local environment, and they even brew beer with it called Chicha.  We have yet to try Chicha, I think it is mostly for the locals.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/63828c29d7.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We did a little shopping at the local market where Jane bought a hand made silver necklace, and we enjoyed a delicious meal&hellip;  It seems there is no avoiding chicken and rice in Peru.  Thankfully they cook it in many different ways!  We checked in to the hotel and were immediately captivated by the Jacuzzi!</p>
<p>Our schedule for the next day was for our guide to pick us up at the very reasonable hour of 8AM!  This day we had three amazing stops.  First was a textile demonstration at a women’s cooperative in Chinchero.  It was fascinating to see the hand weaving and how much work goes into making blankets, and belts, and sweaters, and yes ponchos.  it may not have been the smartest purchase I ever made, but if you see me wearing it around the cabin or the city you will know that I am wearing a hand made, waterproof, Alpaca poncho.  Don’t worry, I didn’t buy the hat!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2749f86038.jpg" alt="Brad Poncho"></p>
<p>Our next stop was the terraces of Moray.  I was not prepared for this at all!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f7fb22b8ef.jpg" alt="Moray Terraces"></p>
<p>Were they made by Aliens?  What were these for?  Who made them?  According to our guide these were constructed by the Inca people between 1000 and 1400.  Research indicates that these terraces were actually agricultural laboratories!  By studying the DNA in the soil they have found that they were learning how to grow many different varieties of potatoes at different altitudes!</p>
<p>It blows me away sometimes to think about the knowledge that we have lost over time.  When the Spanish conquered the Inca king and subdued the people and stopped their work, think of the progress and the knowledge that was lost.  I’ve had this same thought in many parts of the world such as Pompeii. It makes me appreciate Google’s mission to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful.  It also makes me wonder what could cause the loss of all of the information stored in the Google database?  What could cause a similar collapse of a technological empire such as the world we live in today?</p>
<p>We learned that Inca is not really the proper term for the people, the Incas were the rulers the people were Quechua.  Our guide explained that it would be like calling all of the Egyptians Pharos.  I’m sure we will learn a lot more of their history when we visit Machu Picchu.</p>
<p>From the terraces we continued on to the Maras salt pans.  Here we saw 5000 small salt pans where people make salt that comes from a salty spring.  Deep in the Andes there is a giant salt deposit that this water works its way through, it then flows down this valley and through the many pans that people have created over the years to make salt.  Nowadays they actually make more money from tourism than salt, but I can’t help but think that is a short term setback until some marketer comes along and makes Peruvian Pink salt the next hot commodity for home gourmets.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/92e07bdfee.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>By the time we finished with all of this it was time for a late Peruvian lunch (2pm) which we enjoyed in the company of our guide and driver all the while just looking at the mountains that surrounded us on all sides.  It really is beautiful here in the Sacred Valley!</p>

			 <p>When is a vacation not a vacation?  When you are on your third day in a row getting up between 4 and 5 AM.  It turns out that the animals are on a little different schedule than we humans.</p>
<p>Our first morning at Tambopata we had to be in the boat at 4:30 to head to the island where we were going to observe the Colorado Clay lick.  We were literally up before the birds in order to watch the birds have their breakfast.  It turns out that the best theory for why the birds in this area lick the clay is that it is like a vitamin supplement, providing additional sodium and other minerals in their environment that they do not get from the other stuff that they eat.</p>
<p>We set up our viewing point across a narrow branch of the river from the clay and settled in on our stools before the sun came up.  We had a bit of coffee to keep comfortable (and awake) as we listened to mostly the silence and waited.  Soon the sun started to rise and we spotted a pair of Capibaras swimming in the channel, soon the the silence was broken by a few bird calls which continued to build and build until it was a raucous cacophony of Parrot and Macaw sounds!  We saw thousands of Parrots and small green Macaws, we also saw many of the large reds and the blue and greens.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/3f398fc271.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We returned from the clay lick in time for breakfast and a short break before our morning hike to the river overlook.  Before we left we were lucky enough to get to watch the Macaw researchers climb the tree containing two Macaw chicks.  These are part of their preservation research and so every couple of days they take the chicks out of the nest, weigh and measure them to make sure they are thriving.  Macaws are not worried about the humans touching their chicks!  In fact part of their research has shown that they will willingly adopt the chicks of other Macaws that are unable to care for their babies.  Occasionally the Macaws will have 3 or even 4 eggs, however they are only able to forage for enough food for two chicks.  So the last to be born are ignored.  These researchers obtained permission to transplant these third or fourth children to nests where there is only one or even zero babies.  The researcher told us about a nest that was struck by lightning and both babies were killed.  After a time they moved two chicks into the care of the bereaved parents and after some initial confusion on their part the parents started to care for the new chicks.</p>

<p>This next image is of the parents of the baby keeping a careful watch on the researcher who climbed up to the nest.</p>

<p>You never know what you are going to see on one of the jungle hikes, Today we saw a lot of butterflies and Macaws and spiders, some particularly rare bird that our guide was super excited about but didn’t seem that interesting to me.  It was also super hot and really humid!  It was all really interesting and once we got to the river we were treated to some great views.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c026402b9e.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We decided that we were going to rest during the shorter afternoon hike and conserve our energy for the night hike.</p>
<p>The jungle walk in the dark was very cool.  We stopped at one spot that we had walked by many times on the way to and from the river to observe a tarantula nest!  Yikes!  I can’t believe we walked by there all those times.  I think there are millions of things in the jungle that we walk by all the time without noticing.</p>
<p>We also saw some pretty cool insects and even a scorpion hiding in the bark of a tree.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9212584840.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9cea665705.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After the night hike we had to get our bags packed and outside our door so the porters could have them loaded onto the boat for our 5:15 AM departure back to civilization the next morning.</p>
<p>The trip back down the river went much faster than the trip up the river — we were going with the current after all.  We saw a beautiful sunrise and had a very relaxing ride.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/70369c475c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We are really glad that we made the effort to visit and appreciate this amazing part of our planet.</p>
<p><strong>Fun Fact</strong></p>
<p>One of these trees served as the model for the trees in the movie Avatar, the other is inspired by the trees in Avatar. I’m sure you can guess which is which?  We were lucky to see both of them in the span of two months.</p>

			 <p>We walked to the light rail station which took us to MSP, from there we flew to Atlanta and onward to Lima Peru.  We spent a very short night in the airport hotel, just across the street from the airport.  `After five hours of sleep we had a quick breakfast and headed back across the street where we flew to Cusco and then onward to Puerto Maldonado.  We were met outside the gate by our guide where we took a short transfer to the boat and a few hours later we were in the rain forrest.</p>
<p>It rained for most of our boat ride to the lodge, but by the time we arrived it was clearing.  This meant that we could do the hike to the observation tower.  A 120 foot high tower that lets you observe all the different layers of the jungle canopy, including from high above where you can see for miles!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/29200e70ea.jpg" alt="Canopy View"></p>
<p>While we were enjoying our view we were joined by a clan of howler monkeys!  It was amazing to watch them from above, climb through the trees and then finally up one of the support cables to the observation tower.  We were a little worried they might start coming up the stairs but they kept right on moving and climbed down the wire on the other side.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/57fff79e0d.jpg" alt="Howler Monkeys"></p>
<p>We at dinner as a group, along with our guide at 7:30 and by 8:45 we were in bed.  We were tired from the travel and we had a 4AM wake up for the next morning to head out to the lake and then onward for another 5 hours up the river to the Tambopata Research Center.</p>
<p>If you have never heard howler monkeys its really quite a thing!  About 5AM we heard a sound that was just like an approaching windstorm.  That is the sound that howler monkeys make in the morning to mark their territory. Incredible.</p>
<p>After a short boat ride we had about a 30 minute hike to the ox bow lake where we would go in search of the Anaconda (Still looking), the Caiman (a Peruvian alligator - also still looking), many birds, and do some fishing.</p>
<p>Well, you may be wondering what do you fish for in the Amazon? Piraña of course!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7f4c0ef0af.jpg" alt="Piraña Fishing"></p>
<p>It looks a lot like a Sunfish at first glance.  At least until you get a close up look at the teeth!  Also, you do not typically use raw beef when fishing for Sunnies!</p>
<p>After our fishing excursion we were back on the river headed to our final destination for the day, which is the Tambopata Research Center.  This is one of the only places in the national reserve that you can stay overnight and learn about the jungle.  It is really an amazing experience.</p>
<p>Along the way we were keeping our eyes peeled for interesting wildlife sightings.  We were richly rewarded when one of the crew spotted a Jaguar.  Right out in the open sunning itself!  It’s by far the best “big cat” siting we have ever had in all our travels, and I was thrilled to get some good shots.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5ea1eb61bb.jpg" alt="Jaguar in shade"></p>
<p>As a final treat for the day we saw a bunch of Macaws at the “clay lick”. More on clay licking tomorrow after we learn more!</p>

			 <p>Turn left at the arrow.  Hmmm?  Would you turn left and head into the rocks here?  Despite the giant arrow made of rocks right in the middle of the path it is really easy to miss.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/05111054ec.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Even when you realize this is the start its a little hard to believe that this is a real trail. But it doesn’t take long before you find the first ladder and then you know you are on your way.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/b4ad859669.jpg" alt="ladders"></p>
<p>Then you get into the narrow slot canyons and you can really enjoy the hike.  Even though this is not a well marked hike so you might feel a little like you are heading into the unknown.</p>
<p><img src="/images/ladder_slots.jpg" alt="ladder slots"></p>
<p>The going is a bit slow but when you arrive at the top you are rewarded with a great view.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e97c604dee.jpg" alt="ladder view"></p>
<p>The way down is much wider and more open through the beautiful painted canyon.  This was a great way to spend part of our last day of 2018.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/073bc17d99.jpg" alt="painted canyon"></p>
<p>I like this hiking tradition ever since we saw the <code>#optoutside</code> from REI a few years ago on Thanksgiving.  Tomorrow we’ll continue the tradition at Joshua Tree.</p>

<p>What country would you be in if I told you the following facts?</p>
<ul>
<li>90% of the people are home owners, 10% are renters and 0% are
homeless</li>
<li>There is no unemployment</li>
<li>Possession of a firearm is a capital offense</li>
<li>Possession of drugs is a capital offense</li>
<li>Universal helthcare</li>
<li>You cannot buy alchohol (except in a bar) between the hours of 10pm
and 7am</li>
<li>If you have a job lined up your are welcome</li>
<li>If you are a refugee you are out of luck</li>
<li>you will pay around 20% of your salary for social security and your
employer will contribute another 17% but you don&rsquo;t pay any income
tax.</li>
<li>If you want to buy an Audi plan on spending around a half million
dollars</li>
<li>You will not see any trash in the streets</li>
<li>You can leave your bike unlocked or your purse on the table and
nobody will steal it.</li>
<li>Home to the world&rsquo;s second busiest port</li>
</ul>
<p>If you thought I was describing some &ldquo;commie socialist dictatorship&rdquo;
you would be wrong. If you said Singapore, you are correct. I will admit
that all of these facts come from our most excellent bike tour guide
from Urban Adventures, so some of it could be &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; or just a
simple embellishment by someone who is very proud of their country. I
haven&rsquo;t fact checked any of it yet. But for as much as we saw some
pretty cool parts of Singapore today we heard a lot that really made us
think.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2595be5035.jpg" alt="The Wall Street area of Singapore atnight."></p>
<p>Maybe the banner picture gave it away before you even read the question?
The Marina Bay Sands hotel is the largest in Singapore and has some very
distinctive architecture. A ship on top of the three towers, the hotel
is owned by the Sands hotel in Las Vegas. It&rsquo;s a massive hotel with a
casino and mall and botanical gardens and a very distinctive
architectural landmark of Singapore. Honestly, the Asian and
Middle-Eastern architecure we have seen on this trip make America seem
really boring. Hey, lets &ldquo;make American architecture great again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the reasons there is no homelessness is that the government
provides social housing. For as little as $30 / month for those who
qualify you can rent a small 600 square foot apartment. To qualify for
the next level of social housing, you have to be married and at least 21
years old in order to qualify for social housing if your job is paying
less than $90,000 / year. that may seem like a lot, but it is the
average income for Singapore. Once you are in at this level you can stay
in for life if you want. Or you can even make improvements and sell your
place for a profit later when you want to move into even more expensive
private housing.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/07aa82e31b.jpg" alt="They even have a special boat to scoop up the garbage that gets intothe river from the storm sewers"></p>
<p>The government is run like a large multi-national corporation. The
president makes 4 million a year and if you are elected you can expect
to make about a million per year. Our guide put it this way, if you pay
peanuts you will only get monkeys. Enough said.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9f54e5ad1e.jpg" alt="Clarks Quay from the night boattour."></p>
<p>Of course this is all true of a country that has a total population of
around 5 million people and is only 278 square miles in size -- That is
a bit smaller than New York City. It is home to the world&rsquo;s second
busiest port and the world&rsquo;s number one airport. The government is run
like a business to make money and last year they were 9 billion in the
black. I think its easy for an American to look at this wistfully and
say what can we learn? Why can&rsquo;t we be more like this? But I think that
is a pretty complicated question that brings into focus our freedoms and
our history. I&rsquo;d be happy to outlaw guns, but I&rsquo;m not sure sure we
should turn away refugees and others in search of a better life. I
definitely wouldn&rsquo;t want to pay half a million for my Audi! But I would
support more use of mass transit and more biking in our cities.</p>

			 <h1 id="bond-james-bond-island">Bond, James Bond... Island</h1>
<p>Wrong side of the island, wrong end of the beach! That would be the
headline for the way our trip started this morning. We got off the ship
with a group of 13 that had banded together through Cruise Critic to
head off on a swimming, snorkeling and boating trip together. However,
it was a bit chaotic at the start. While we could have anchored on the
side of the island by the marinas we instead anchored on the other side
of the island. And while our guide knew the beach we were supposed to
tender into he was informed that we would be tendering to the other end
of the beach. So when we got off and started looking for the sign that
read &ldquo;Jane Miller Group&rdquo; we were suprised to not see one. One taxi
driver that had wanted to sell us a tour ended up being particularly
nice when he offered to let us use his phone to contact the tour
company. They were at the wrong end of the beach which was a long long
walk, so they said we should walk to the &ldquo;family mart&rdquo; and wait.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cd5f73aff7.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>before we even got to the family mart one of our new friends said
&ldquo;Jane, here&rsquo;s your van&rdquo;. Sure enough there was a driver with a &ldquo;Jane
Miller&rdquo; sign. Unfortunately he didn&rsquo;t have enough room for all of us
in the van. So Jane said I should go with the main group and she would
wait for a car and ride with our new friends Mike and Karen. Mike is an
old army vet who now works as a defense contracter in South Korea
teaching war gaming, and Karen is from Austin MN. Although there is a
bit of an age gap, we have a lot in common and they were fun to talk to
and always up for an adventure.</p>
<p>It was forty five minutes later when we finally arrived at the marina
and I had just pulled out my phone and turned on the international plan
so I could text jane and find out where she was!? Before I could press
the send button however I noticed that she and Mike and Karen were all
waiting for us on the sidewalk! OK, mission accomplished, we are all at
the marina we can get this show underway. After a short trip to the
nearby souvenier store where we paid double the usual cost for our Thai
beers and we were ready to board our pink carriage to the boat halfway
down the pier.</p>
<p>In our pre-trip briefing, both the owner and our guide for the day
assured us that we were going to be back to the dock in plenty of time
because they didn&rsquo;t want anyone to stress about making it back on time
for the last tender back to the ship. Great! This sounds good. There is
nothing I hate more than wondering if we are going to make it back
before the ship leaves.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/b17499642c.jpg" alt="This one was taken by our guide using hisdrone."></p>
<p>A half hour later we were at our first stop and in the 85 degree water.
Very nice and warm for swimming especially after all of our rushing
around this morning and then sitting close together (with life jackets
on!! to appease the local authorities) for the first part of the
journey. Life jackets were now stowed away for the rest of the trip!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/72f4d3d7c3.jpg" alt="One of the many beautiful islands in thebay."></p>
<p>Following the swimming we motored to a group of islands called Phang-Nga
bay. These islands were beautiful and reminded us of our time in Halong
Bay, Vietnam. We stopped at Ice Cream cave and went spelunking! It was
really pretty and brought us through the island where we could see the
other side.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/b828e0b7c8.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We pulled up to a small beach at a national park for lunch. We had a
fabulous Thai lunch. By the time we finished lunch it was after 2pm and
our guide said we would see James Bond island, the floating village and
then do some kayaking before making our way back to the marina at high
speed but still an hour away. A few of us began to wonder out loud about
the 4:00 return time. It turned out that the tide had gone out and the
water was quite shallow to get to the floating village so we had to go
slow. I think it was at that point that our guide finally re-did the
math in his head and announced that we should choose whether we wanted
to see the village or Kayak. None of us could see that Kayaking made any
sense, given that we would have had about 5 minutes time to do so. In
reality we should have headed back right after James Bond island.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Phuket/bond_island.jpg" alt="The island from James Bond: The Man with the GoldenGun"></p>
<p>In the end we arrived back at the marina closer to 4:30 and we could
tell they were wanting us to really hurry to get to the vans and on our
way back to the ship. Given that it had taken 45 minutes to get there in
the morning I was wondering how this was going to end. fortunately our
afternoon driver seemed to know a much better route than our morning
driver and it really only took 20 minutes to get back, so all was well.</p>
<p>Days like today are my one knock against cruises like this. You just
don&rsquo;t really have enough time to do the things you&rsquo;d like to do
without the pressure of going right up against getting on board at the
last second. This was true for us in Kuala Lumpur as well as there was a
whole hour long drive from the port just to get into the city. When you
do a land tour you don&rsquo;t have those daily deadlines, and you can take
your time exploring a bit more.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it was &ldquo;white night&rdquo; on the ship tonight and we got
back in plenty of time to enjoy the sunset.</p>

			 <h1 id="cooking-with-pearly">Cooking with Pearly</h1>
<p>Stand under the clock tower facing the roundabout at 9:00 and my husband
will find you. Those were our instructions from Pearly, our instructor
for the day. So we did, Jane and I plus our two friends Rob and Joan.
Pearly&rsquo;s husband was a bit surprised to find Rob and Joan with us, but
there was room in the class and it was no problem. Just a couple of more
things to pick up at the market.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4287ba17bf.jpg" alt="The chickens were super fresh. Killed in one room (barely out ofsight) and served right next door."></p>
<p>Chanda, Pearly&rsquo;s husband drove us to the market where we waited for
Pearly to arrive with the rest of the class. Then our lessons started.
She did a great job of showing us around the market introducing us to
all of the Malaysian produce. She was particularly focused on educating
us about the various health benefits of all of the different kinds of
root vegetables. By the time it was over I actually kind of wanted to
eat a healthier diet with more greens and veggies. You read it here
first folks! We also had the opportunity to try some great street food,
including some peanut pancakes and some rice hoppers that were made with
noodles, cane sugar, and coconut. Delicious!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7972c64e3b.jpg" alt="Pearly, extolling the virtues of some rootvegetable."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9195ce7539.jpg" alt="A street vendor preparing our peanut pancakes.Delicious!"></p>
<p>After the market tour we drove to Pearly and Chanda&rsquo;s home where she
gave us a tour of the garden and then brought us to our cooking
stations. Since Jane and I were the first to sign up for the class we
got to choose the dishes to make! We made three dishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curry Kapitan</li>
<li>Sambal Goreng -- Prawns in Cashew nut sauce</li>
<li>Ngor Hiang Lor Bak - 5 spice pork roll</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these is the traditional Penang curry that we eat back home, but
they are all traditional Nyonya dishes. Pearly is a fifth generation
chinese living in Penang and they are the Nyonya. Over the years of
cooking for the British they developed a style of cooking that was very
flavorful but not as spicy as their Thai counterparts.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/36e3b46e24.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In each step of the work we washed everything thoroughly in a large bowl
of fresh water at each of our stations. This was a little different than
how I had cooked before, but the produce was all fresh and so whether it
was to make sure we coaxed out any weavels hiding in the nuts or just to
make sure we rinsed away any extra dirt or other nasty matter from the
lemon grass or dried chilis or Galangal roots it seemed like a good
idea.</p>
<p>When we first started it seemed like we might be in an episode of
&ldquo;worst cooks&rdquo; as some of our classmates immediately knocked their
ingredients on the ground and started cutting things up all wrong. But
Pearly had pretty good humor about it and we spent most of our time
laughing. She did go a little overboard at one point grabbing the spoon
out of Jane&rsquo;s hand in a misguided effort to &ldquo;save her peppers&rdquo; after
her instructions about what to do were not entirely clear.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t finish cooking and eating until 2:00 in the afternoon, but
the time went by very quickly.</p>

<p>On our first day at sea we looked at the schedule of activities on board
the ship and Jane said, &ldquo;We should go take a bridge lesson.&rdquo; Having
tried to learn bridge before I thought it sounded like a fun idea, maybe
it would stick this time. So we showed up at the appointed time of 10AM
and there were a bunch of us. We were among the youngest but certainly
not the only people in our age bracket. Our teacher was named Rhoda,
clearly a longtime New Yorker. Also a lifelong teacher, she taught
reading for most of her career. Most of the other beginners had never
even played cards before so I have to give them credit for starting with
Bridge. All our nights of 500 were a definite advantage in the playing
phase of Bridge. We didn&rsquo;t even start learning how to bid until the
second lesson, but before we knew it we were adding high card points,
learning about 5 card major openings, Jacoby transfers, Staymen, forcing
bids, no trump responses, and the other conventions of American Standard
bridge bidding!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bfdb1eb615.jpg" alt="This is Rhoda. She was a great teacher and really funny! If I canremember her little memory ditties for remembering all the bridgestrategy she taught us I might actually get goodsomeday."></p>
<p>After bridge I was off to check out the cooking class for Indian Butter
Chicken, and Jane was headed to water color painting class. I turned out
that I had misread the time for the cooking class, but at least I got to
taste the result and get the recipe! I also wanted to check out the
trivia challenge and then sing with the Highseas Choir. (get it
high-C&rsquo;s). I showed up at trivia at 12:15 and was invited to join a
couple from Canada to see if we could form a team, we were soon joined
by Beverly (a librarian!) and so it was that on our first day we had a
team of four, which everyone else was at 8! Unsurprisingly we were
second to last after the first day. However in this progressive trivia
challenge the points double each day. So on the next day I made Jane
join in, and little by little we grew our team, and our scores increased
and we moved up the rankings. By the last day we were in second place!
One part of our strategy was to make use of the fact that you can
request categories. I requested computer programming and cooking. The
&ldquo;programming&rdquo; question the next day was &ldquo;What does HTTP stand for?&rdquo;.
Ha! Only two of us in the room knew the answer to that one. Its not
really a programming question if you ask me, but I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>Starting in second place on the last day, we knew it was still almost
anybody&rsquo;s game as the points that day were worth more than all the
previous days put together. But after the questions were in, and they
read through the answers we realized that we had only missed two and
many other teams were not cheering too much as the answers were read.
When it was all added up we won!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/86b677d0cd.jpg" alt="Our first place certificate, but we got a bag full of other Azamaraswag; including a cup, a keychain, a t-shirt, a microfiber cloth\... youget the idea."></p>
<p>Jane made three watercolor paintings on the ship during her painting
lessons, and I think she should keep it up. There must be someplace in
Minneapolis to take some art lessons to keep improving.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/53d247461f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>All in all the days at sea went by very quickly, and we had planned
really great meals in the specialty restaurants on board for most
evenings at sea. After dinner we did enjoy some of the shows. Except for
the hypnotist. I volunteered to be one of the 10 to be hypnotized but my
brain is just way to busy to enter a trance in a situation like that (or
maybe ever). I was quite convinced that I could not be hypnotized before
I even walked up there which meant I wasn&rsquo;t a good volunteer to begin
with. So no surprise I was the first volunteer to be dismissed. He
insisted on having 10 volunteers so I figure he is just playing the odds
that a certain percentage of the population is susceptible/able to be
hypnotized and some are not.</p>
<p>I also sang in the choir, which was fun, but at the end of it all we
were not very good. You have to listen to each other to sing, and most
people in the choir were not good listners. Still it does make me want
to get my voice back in shape and join a choir back in Minneapolis.</p>

			 <h1 id="sunrise-to-sunset-in-bagan-myanmar">Sunrise to Sunset in Bagan, Myanmar</h1>
<p>One of the cool things about this Azamara journey is that the ship stays
for three nights in Yangon (old Rangoon) which allows some of the more
adventurous travelers the opportunity to do an overnight trip to the
interior of Myanmar (formerly known as Burma). Our friends Ann and Jerry
got us very excited about seeing the temples of Bagan so this was the
perfect opportunity to do that.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bda6310b39.jpg" alt="sixteen people to a balloon in the early morning over the temples ofBagan"></p>
<p>Jane worked with Trufflepig travel agency to plan our days to get the
most out of the adventure. Which we definitely did as we were off the
ship early on our first morning in port and were were among the very
last handful of passengers to board less than an hour before we sailed
away from Myanmar! Our first day was a fairly nice tour of Yangon. The
main attraction is the huge gold covered Schwedagon Pagoda. They were in
the midst of a project they do every five years to replace the gold
plating on the dome of the pagoda. We saw families dressed in their
finest bringing a 10 by 10 inch plate of gold to place in a small cart
that would go by wire up to the dome where it would be put in place.
This must be the most expensive pagoda in the world, as the very tip of
the pagoda is encrusted with diamonds, rubies and sapphire gems worth
millions.</p>
<p>The expense of the pagoda stands in stark contrast to everything around
it. It seems that people are giving away their life savings to decorate
this place. Its a part of the culture that I would definitely like to
understand more about. I should also point out that Myanmar is also
fairly well endowed with gold mines, diamond mines as well as mines
containing rubies and sapphires. But like many of our other stops there
is also a huge amount of poverty.</p>
<p>The flight to Bagan was about an hour aboard a propjet plane, and we
were met by our guide, Mr. Htay, and driver for our time in Bagan for
the short five minute ride to the Aureum Palace Hotel. A beautiful 5
star hotel where the bathroom in our villa was bigger than our entire
stateroom on the ship! The dining and pool areas of the hotel overlook
several smaller pagoda (pagodas? pagodi?). Although it was still only
around 7pm we ate dinner at the hotel. The menu was a very international
menu including burmese, Thai, Italian, and American fare. Our server
recommended anything from the Thai menu as the chef was from Thailand
and very good. I had the Pad Bai Kra Prao Gai -- something I&rsquo;m
determined to cook at home. its a bit similar to Laarb but spicy instead
of bright and fresh. Its ground chicken mixed with spices and spicy
basil served over rice.</p>
<p>After dinner it was early to bed, partly because I was suffering from a
nasty cold and partly because we knew we had a 4:40 alarm set to get up
for our balloon ride the next morning! I slept well until 2AM and then
spent the rest of the night tossing and turning waiting for that early
alarm to go off, and anticipating the balloon ride! See the gallery at
the end of this post for a bunch of photos.</p>
<p>We travelled to the launch site in a Carbus! The Carbus is a vehicle
that was made in Canada and used by the Allies in World War II. At the
end of the war there were 206,000 of these vehicles in Burma but it was
too expensive to ship them all back home so they were just left here.
Over the years the burmese have restored them, replaced and engines, and
used them for various purposes. The windows were open air, or you could
pull up some wooden shutters to block the early morning breeze which we
did since it was the first time since leaving home that we were a bit
chilly. (it was probably 69 degrees out)</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5a6b5b44cd.jpg" alt="Seeing the temples from the air was one of the highlights of the wholetrip."></p>
<p>We arrived at the launch site in darkness where they had coffee and tea
waiting for us and then it was on to our safety briefing. As the sky
began to turn gray in the east the safety briefing was over and it was
time to inflate the balloons! What a fascinating process, to watch them
start up fans and then run around inside the balloon making sure
everything was in place. After the balloons were about three quarters
inflated they started the burners and started shooting flames into the
balloon, which very quickly became upright and ready for us to board!
There were sixteen passengers in four compartments of the basket. The
pilot, Fernando, was in the middle with his tanks of fuel and his ipads
to show the wind speeds at various altitudes. it took a lot of hot air
to get all seventeen of us into the air, but it was so gentle and
amazing that you didn&rsquo;t even realize you were leaving the ground. Once
airborn we were all just mesmerized by everything! temples in every
direction and the sun just peeking over the horizon.</p>
<p>We were probably in the air for a little over an hour and I alternated
between madly taking pictures trying to capture the experience and just
leaving my camera hanging so I could fully enjoy the experience! There
were 23 balloons in the air that morning and part of the beauty of the
experience was seeing all of the other balloons around us. It was all
over too quickly when we landed (on our second attempt) in the middle of
a field. Our pilot had to hold a delicate balance between letting the
balloon deflate a bit versus keeping it upright enough so that the
basket didn&rsquo;t tip and drag until the ground crew caught up with us.</p>
<p>After we got out of the balloon we celebrated our journey with an early
morning champagne toast. The first balloon flight was in the Champagne
region of france so apparently this is a tradition followed after all
balloon flights. Our pilot got into ballooning when he got fed up
waiting for parts for an ultralight plane. Now he owns his own company
in Spain, and spends five months of the year in Bagan doing balloon
rides and five months in the south of france doing balloon rides. Quite
an interesting life if you ask me!</p>
<p>After the balloon we returned in our Carbus to the hotel where we
cleaned up, had breakfast and then met our guide for our eBike tour of
the temples of Bagan. the eBike was a great way to explore the backroads
around the temples. We explored a few that were off the beaten path and
getting a bit overgrown, and then we saw a few of the popular ones that
we had seen from the air. It was really interesting to have a good guide
for this part of the trip as the walls of the temples are like history
books. The different paintings and the stories they all tell always make
me wish I had done more homework before visiting.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bb3af3cebc.jpg" alt="Temples all have a North, South, East and West facing Buddha at theentrance. The biggest and fanciest have two square corridors, an innerand outer."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7a40abd418.jpg" alt="Seeing the temples on an electric scooter is the way togo!"></p>
<p>After a few hours of &ldquo;templing&rdquo; we drove our scooters to a monastery
and had a huge burmese lunch. It is said that one of the kings in Bagan
never had a meal with less than 300 dishes. We had 30. The traditional
meal is to have a main curry and rice dish and then many many side
dishes. We had two different beef curries and one chicken curry. That
leaves 27 different side dishes. From tofu to pickled bean sprouts to
mashed gooseberries to spicy toasted nuts. We managed to try a bit of
everything between us. Many of them we didn&rsquo;t like at all because they
were just too bitter for our western taste buds. I&rsquo;m not sure that even
my friend (JMS) would have cleaned up all the food they served us.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5b38151184.jpg" alt="Lunch at the monestary. You can see all of the side dishes we hadaround the outside of the circle."></p>
<p>One of the best things about our guide was that he didn&rsquo;t overdue the
temples. After lunch he said we could continue if we wanted or we could
go back to the room for some rest and refreshment before he picked us up
at 4:00 for our carriage ride and sunset watching. We opted for resting
and trying out the rum sour drinks from the hotel bar that our guide had
recommended we sample. They were very refreshing all on their own.</p>
<p>The carriage ride was very peacful and the sunset was beautiful.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e86b947988.jpg" alt="Sunset over the temples"></p>
<p>After sunset we were beat, so we had an early dinner by the pool and
enjoyed the reflection of the nearby temples in pool. It was another
early night to bed as we knew we were off to the airport first thing in
the morning.</p>
<p>My one worry about the hole Bagan adventure had been that we were not
leaving ourselves a very good safety margin for getting back to the ship
at the end of it all. Our flight was schedule to arrive at 10:10 and the
roads and traffic in Yangon are so bad that it takes at least an hour
and a half to drive from the port to the airport. With our ship leaving
at 1:00 I would have liked a bit more time. On top of that virtually
everyone we met was flying back the night before for that very reason.
Of course they all missed the sunset. So... when the time to board our
plane passed and the ground crew told me that our flight was delayed by
30 minutes due to weather in Heho my stomach began to churn a bit. My
internal safety deadline of 11:00 was getting uncomfortably close. Of
course we knew that we had our passports and credit cards and more than
a day to catch up with the ship in Phuket if we &ldquo;missed the boat.&rdquo; So
there really wasn&rsquo;t anything to worry about. But sometimes you still do
even when you shouldn&rsquo;t. Our plane landed at 10:50 and our guide was
waiting for us. He joked that they had the privte jet all fueled up and
ready to take us to Phuket, but we made it back to the ship before it
sailed anyway.</p>

			 <h1 id="yala-safari">Yala Safari</h1>
<p>Today we got caught up in a traffic jam in the middle of the Yala
National Park in Sri Lanka! But it was for a good reason, a Leopard.
After many hours of bumping around the jungle in a jeep and seeing lots
of different animals we still had not seen a leopard. We really didn&rsquo;t
expect to as it was hot and the middle of the day. Most of the sane
leopards were hidden away napping on tree branches. We knew that
something was up as soon as our driver hit the gas pedal. We had learned
over the course of the day that when he sped up and started driving like
a madman it was because some other driver had seen something cool and it
had come down their phone tree. How they tell each other their position
out there is something only they know, I think, as there are thousands
of paths and zero road signs.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of flying along we ended up at the back of a very
long line of jeeps going nowhere. initially the word was that it was a
crocodile, which didn&rsquo;t seem all that likely as a croc would not
attract this much attention. Eventually we learned that it was a
Leopard! What a bonus that we were actually going to see one. After
nearly a half hour of inching forward one car at a time we were pointed
in the right direction by several of the guides who were standing by the
side of the road trying to keep everyone moving. It was quite far in the
distance but I did get a great view of it with the binoculars.
Unfortunately it was too far away for any kind of recognizability unless
you really zoom in like below.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/238da41f11.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Not everyone in the Jeep was so lucky and we learned a good lesson about
traveling with tired and crabby people. The poor driver was just doing
his job and following instructions. But after six hours in a jeep in 90
degree weather, it was a bit much for one couple who had been bickering
with each other all day!</p>
<p>The following is a gallery of some of my favorite photos taken during
the day. Enjoy! And if you ever get to Sri Lanka I recommend you plan a
day like this.</p>

			 <h1 id="driving-a-tuk-tuk-in-colombo">Driving a Tuk Tuk in Colombo</h1>
<p>This morning we had a morning at sea and we arrived in Colombo Sri Lanka
noon. Jane had arranged a tuk tuk tour for us and several other people
from the cruise critic message boards. We made our way off the ship and
negotiated a taxi to take us to the hotel where we were to meet our
drivers and tuk tuks. In case you&rsquo;ve never experienced a tuk tuk it is
a three wheeled vehicle with a motorcyle engine. The driver sits in the
front and 2 or maybe 3 passengers sit in the back. These vehicles are
all over in the cities of Asia and can drive in ways that cars cannot!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/331f232881.jpg" alt="Our tour started out with some delicious coconut water for us to sipas we drove around the city."></p>
<p>The first thing we noticed is what a different vibe there is in Colombo
versus the cities in India. The driving is more orderly, the city seemed
quite well maintained from the lack of garbage in the streets to the
upkeep of the buildings. We visited a Buddhist temple, saw &ldquo;the white
house&rdquo;, visited a Hindu temple, the national cricket grounds, and some
of their national monuments.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/48db19806d.jpg" alt="Enjoying the open air tour of Colombo aboard our tuk tuk with ourdriver &ldquo;Big Show&rdquo;."></p>
<p>For me the highlight of the day was when we were on a pretty out of the
way street and our driver pulled over and asked if I wanted to drive.
Now I&rsquo;m not even a motorcycle driver, but that didn&rsquo;t deter me from
giving it a shot. Unlike a motorcycle the clutch is on the left and
along with the shifting mechanism, the throttle is on the right hand
along with the break. I made it into first gear without any trouble and
then paniced when I heard someone coming up from behind me. I slowed
down and forgot to engage the clutch. Wah wah wah... But then we
started it up again and I was good for at least 1 kilometer.</p>
<p>The funniest thing was that as we were motoring down the road with me
driving we were passed by a policeman! It was pretty clear to all
concerned that I didn&rsquo;t have a license, but he just smiled and
continued on his way. Jane was in the back making a video and thought
the whole thing was quite funny.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4a10fc859b.jpg" alt="Brad, the Ace tuk tuk driver!"></p>
<p>While we were at the national cricket grounds, I noticed that they had
something called &ldquo;Hoppers&rdquo; on the menu. So I asked our guide about it.
He explained that they were like crispy pancakes that you stuffed with
different fillings and rolled up to eat. A few minutes later he was on
the phone and arranging for us to have hoppers on our lunch stop! They
were delicious. We had some spicy filling called pol sambola to use with
one plain hopper and one egg hopper. Both were really good. Then we had
a delicous chicken Kottu a mixture of roti and vegetables and chicken,
served with a dark garlic curry. We were running a bit behind schedule
but we were all so glad that we got to experience this great food
instead of rushing back to the ship to make the dinner buffet! For
desert we had some delicious buffalo milk curd with honey drizzled on
top. Time to find a Sri-Lankan cookbook to see if I can recreate any of
this at home.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7022ed2c8c.jpg" alt="This sign says a lot. Nobody readsit!"></p>
<p>I think that no blogging about India would be complete without some
comment on the driving! It is a great example of both the chaos and
cooperation present in the culture of India. It is utter chaos in that
although there are line lines painted on the roads, very few drivers
seem to care. Where there is only one lane you might find two or even
three vehicles side by side depending on the size of the vehicles.
Passing? No problem you can pull part way out of the lane to pass, the
vehicle in front of you will probably move over a bit to the left and
the oncoming traffic will likely move a bit to the right so you can get
around! I don&rsquo;t know what the statistics on traffic accidents or
fatalities are in India, but amazingly we didn&rsquo;t see any during our
visit to either Mumbai or Kochin. I tried to make a video out the front
of the bus as we were driving down the road and staring into an oncoming
truck. But it didn&rsquo;t turn out so you&rsquo;ll just have to trust me on this
one!</p>
<p>Our day in Kochin was mostly spent on a small bus studying the driving
habits of the natives, but we did make two very interesting stops. The
first stop was to do a two hour ride on a large houseboat that took us
through the canals and waterways of Kochin. We got to see the
countryside and the rice paddys. It was really good to get out of the
city!</p>

<p><img src="/images/kochi/rice_paddy.jpg" alt="The rice paddy. Our guide said that we were in the Holland of Indiabecause the land is below sea level in thisarea."></p>
<p>Our second interesting stop was at a small bridge where we could see the
famous chinese fishing nets in action. These nets have been in use for
centuries and it was fascinating to see them catching and hauling in the
fish.</p>

			 <h1 id="first-world-problems">First World Problems</h1>
<p>&ldquo;First world problems eh?&rdquo; We all use that phrase to acknowledge that
when we are complaining about our iPhone being a little too slow, or our
dinner selections not quite vast enough, we really do get that its not
that important in the grand scheme of things. Today, we experienced life
in the slum of Mumbai known as Dharavi, and it put into perspective the
distance between our first world problems and real life. I don&rsquo;t think
I&rsquo;ll use that phrase anymore as it feels like it doesn&rsquo;t come close to
recognizing the challenges faced by those living outside the first
world.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ba0e6e4902.jpg" alt="Washing the clothes"></p>
<p>Jane arranged our tour of Mumbai through a tour group called reality
tours. They were excellent and I would highly recommend you use them if
you ever visit Mumbai. Not only are the guides excellent but 80% of the
proceeds from your tour dollars go straight into their community. Their
community happens to be in one corner of the Dharavi slum. I was
absolutely floored to learn that our tour guide for the day lived in the
slum! I thought that slums were only for the very most poor and
destitute, surely not for someone who was educated, well spoken and hard
working! In fact we learned that many professionals such as teachers and
policemen live in the slums of Mumbai. This reality runs straight
against our American ideals, but we were not in America.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7004ca936f.jpg" alt="The communications hub for the Dharavislum"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that we breathed som pretty toxic fumes on the first
part of our tour today. The slum is divided into two parts, the
commercial and the residential part. In the commercial part it seemed
that recycling was a huge part of the economy, both lastic and aluminum.
The plastic is broken down and then thrown into something that we
Minnesotans would call a wood chipper, which breaks the plastic into
smaller pieces. These pieces are then melted down and extruded into long
strings and finally cut into tiny little lengths which makes little
plastic pellets. These are then sold to manufacturers to be turned into
who knows what. The dust and smell from the plastic can not be good for
you. The same basic process is used for aluminum only that requires a
lot higher temperatures. We saw a bunch of aluminum bricks that were so
hot that people were cooking their lunch on them! In all of this we saw
no hard hats, no safety goggles, and no shoes. We did see a lot of
people working hard to earn money for their family.</p>
<p>In the residential area it was much different. The &ldquo;streets&rdquo; were so
narrow that my shoulders stretched from one side to the other. The
houses are quite small and for the most part families live together in a
10x20 foot room. Our guide was 30 and still lives with his parents and
siblings because he cannot afford his own place. I learned that the
average teacher&rsquo;s salary is the equivalent of $200 per month, so it is
no wonder that housing is hard to afford. Later in the day our guide
took us past the most expensive house in the world a 2+ billion dollar
home built overlooking the sea owned by an indian billionaire.</p>
<p>He explained that the government tried to clean up the slums and built
hi-rise apartments next door for people to move into, but they were so
expensive that nobody could afford them and most ended up moving back.
Living in the slums is not free, people there pay taxes and rent and
bills for water and electricity. Water only runs for a few hours a day,
although electricity is pretty constant. Each home is metered for
electrical use! Although the wires are run so haphazardly I can&rsquo;t
imagine how it is very accurate. We were not allowed to take pictures as
our guide explained we are in people&rsquo;s homes and want to respect their
privacy. Everywhere we went, we were greeted by the children. They were
all smiles and wanted to say hello to us, give us a high five or shake
hands.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/be02dc61b5.jpg" alt="Friendly kids in Dharavi"></p>
<p>Another stop on our journey was the laundry. In a way this is similar to
the slums in that people both live and work in the laundry. This is
where the washing is done for hospitals and hotels and clothing
manufacturers. We were able to take pictures inside here. Each of these
large bins is one small business, doing the washing for someone.</p>
<p>Its all so strange and different, like a step back in time in some ways.
Imagine that your hospital bedding was sterilized by throwing the sheets
into a 50 gallon drum of water heated from below by an open flame!?
Ironing? Of course they have ironing, have you ever seen an iron that is
heated by coal? We saw some of them in use today.</p>
<p>So, although this part of the day was really sobering. We saw some fun
and beautiful sites along the way too. The Victoria train station was
very grand, and our stop at the cricket field was very entertaining.
There must have been at least 100 different cricket games going on
simultaneously. We watched as balls were hit across two, three, or even
more other games. It seemed like total chaos to me, but it was clear
that everyone was having a great time.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/0f5ddfb511.jpg" alt="Cricket Chaos!"></p>
<p>Our tour also featured a stop for some street food! We went to food
stand at the beach owned by Bihm Singh, where we tried a number of
different things. Pani Puri, Sev Puri and Dahi Ragda Puri. The Pani Pur
and Dahi Ragda were both served in crisp little balls, where the cook
punched a hole in the top and then filled the ball with delicious spicy
ingredients. The Sev was more like a nacho in that it was a flat crispy
bit of dough with the ingredients piled high. The way you eat these is
to pop it all in your mouth at once. Jane got a fabulous photo of me
demonstrating how to do this!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7033c6b91a.jpg" alt="Demonstrating the proper Pani Puri eatingtechnique."></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bcf41c1fe3.jpg" alt="Making the Pani Puri"></p>
<p>As far as I could tell the whole place was run on some kind of honor
system. I never saw an order being written down, and yet people were
eating all kinds of things chatting away and ordering and eating and
chatting some more. like much of what we saw it seemed very cooperative
and trusting amongst all of the participants. Such a different feel than
you get in so many places back home.</p>
<p>I think the followup email from our guide sums up the day pretty well
and since I&rsquo;ve been struggling to put the day into words I&rsquo;ll just
quote him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have picked your way through Dharavi&rsquo;s narrow, winding lanes, and
witnessed first hand the communal, enterprising spirit that allows so
many people to survive and thrive despite the many issues that they
face. We hope you&rsquo;ve left having had some of your perceptions about
life here challenged.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which I can only say, &ldquo;mission accomplished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our guide&rsquo;s name was Oscar, He is a Masai from kenya, but immigrated to
Dubai and works tours out of the port at Khor Fakkan. We picked this
excursion because we wanted to get out of the city and into the country
side. We were not dissappointed. We visited four different Emirates on
our trip, but the main feature was when we got offroad and ventured
through the Wadi. A Wadi is more or less a dry streambed most of the
time, except for when it rains. And with less than 200 milimeters of
rain a year that is not much rain.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c75d43137c.jpg" alt="Me, I was thinking about Jonah sitting under the tree outside ofNinevah."></p>
<p>The port of Khar Fakkan is not too developed yet. And is mostly for
container ships. We had heard that it was a busy port but we were the
only ship in port and there were not that many containers. We have a
good alternative theory that the port that is busy is just around the
corner and is the port for all the tankers. When we got a few miles away
from the port we saw the oil tanks. They have a huge pipeline that
brings most of the oil from the emirates to this storage facility. Its
better to be here because the location is not as easily blockaded by
Iran as other Emirate locations! Miles and miles of huge oil tanks, all
storing oil for every brand you can think of.</p>
<p>We made a quick stop at the friday market. We were pretty sure that this
market was just the best place they could find for a short stretch break
on our way to the mountains! Our guide said we could get out and look
but not to buy anything because we didn&rsquo;t have any room in our jeep to
haul it. He was right, although we were in a big Land Cruiser we had our
guide and six passengers.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4247d3590a.jpg" alt="A view of the friday market. Called that becuase friday was the daythey were open and everyone gathered."></p>
<p>As we got to the offroad portion of the trip, Oscar became a bit upset
because the lead car had taken a route he thought was sub-standard. It
kept us inside the wadi instead of the better view by driving along side
and above it. Finally when one car got stuck in a muddy rut (it had
rained last week) he was not too happy, and both Jane and I were
reminded of an earlier adventure when our airboat got stuck in the
Everglades for three hours!</p>
<p>We also made a stop at a luxury hotel for lunch, and a very very short
stop at the oldest mosque in the area. Made of clay and quite small.
They were very strict about enforcing the clothing rules and since I had
not heard about this part of the trip I was not allowed inside in my
shorts. I could have borrowed a long traditional robe, but our stop was
so short that the guides were hurrying everyone to get back in the
trucks before we really figured out what was going on.</p>
<p>When we were getting back on the ship we figured out the reason why they
were rushing us. We were in the last truck as Oscar was clearly one of
the more experienced guides and was trying to keep the younger drivers
in front of him. As we were going through security to get back on the
ship one of the security guys was counting down. I was 8 and jane was 7
there were only six passengers (all behind us) unaccounted for before
the ship could leave port.</p>

			 <h1 id="dubai-city-of-contrasts">Dubai: City of Contrasts</h1>
<p>I once listened to an interesting 99% Invisible podcast that said that
Las Vegas was the petri dish for architecture in the United States. Las
Vegas is also the city that keeps on coming to mind as I visit Dubai.
The variety of architecture here is just amazing, especially in the new
areas of Dubai -- where by new I mean less than 20 years and in many
cases less than 10 years old! There are amazing buildings with modern
architecture everywhere you look. This place is on a mission to make a
statement on a global scale. But even after spending a couple of days
here I&rsquo;m not sure what that statement actually is. <strong>Update:</strong> on our
tour to the Hajar Mountains yesterday our guide said &ldquo;Dubai is the Las
Vegas of the middle east, just without the gambling&rdquo;. So there are two
data points for you on that comparison.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e83e5d46bb.jpg" alt="A night time view of the creek with the dinner cruise dhows. In thebackground you can see the Dubai Frame as well as the BurjKhalifa"></p>
<p>To put a positive spin on it it might be something like this: Visionary
leadership will get you everywhere. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al
Maktoum definitely had a vision and the people here have executed on
that vision. Creating islands shaped like palm trees and soon home to
two of the worlds tallest buildings where just 15 years ago there was
nothing but flat desert.</p>
<p>A slightly more cynical spin would be. Dubai: we have more Guinness
world records than anyone else, you should come shop here! The Mall of
the Emeriates, The City Center Mall, the Marina Mall and of course the
Dubai Mall, which is the largest mall in the world. The new area of
Dubai hosts all of the worlds tallest hotels (at least the top three)
there is the worlds highest swimming pool, the worlds highest
observation deck, the worlds tallest building, with the worlds fastest
elevator, which will soon be supplanted by a different building that
will overcome the soon to be completed tallest building in Saudi Arabia.
The worlds largest indoor ski area -- Yes it has real snow and
operating lifts. This will also be replaced by another indoor ski area
with a much longer run. The worlds largest man-made island. Its really
exhausting to see and list all of these records.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ff1b2db3b8.jpg" alt="A view from the 148th floor of the Burj Khalifa at night. Sadly, theremnants of a sandstorm reduced the daytime view to a grayhaze."></p>
<p>So what is the reason behind all of these records? You might be tempted
to say that it is all due to oil wealth. But Dubai is small and contains
only 4% of the oil reserves in the UAE. A little research will quickly
lead you to the same reason I gave above, vision. It was the vision of
the leadship of Dubai that led to the creation of the infrastructure,
mass transit, and tax systems that have caused massive economic growth.
Foreginers are allowed to own propery and business in designated
business zones. There is no income or sales tax which explains some of
Dubai as a massive shopping destination. And some things, like a man
made island in the shape of a palm tree are just to show off a bit and
attract celebrities to area.</p>
<p>Our hotel was near the Dubai Creek which was dredged and extended as
part of the massive building efforts. But the creek is also the reason
Dubais is located where it is. It is a highly defensible port location
which is still operating today. Ports in Iran and many other Gulf
countries are fairly close, just a 4 hour boat trip to Iran. The Creek
and the port are the intersection of the old and new Dubai as you can
see clearly in the photo.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Dubai/loading_Dhows.jpg" alt="Loading the Dhow for its journey through the Gulf, with new Dubai inthe background."></p>
<p>The Dhows are loaded with all kinds of goods from new and used
electronics to fresh water and furniture to be shipped from Dubai to
other countries. The crime rate is so low that these goods basically sit
here next to a busy street unguarded, waiting to be loaded and shipped
away.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/baa56a345c.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>You can also see the &ldquo;taxi&rdquo; that we used to get from the new side of
the creek to the old side of the creek. The ride was just 1 Durham which
is about a quarter. You simply walk up, hop on and pay the driver his
money. Or a helpful local may grab your 5 give you change and pass on
the bill to the driver!</p>
<p>The highlight of our visit was a middle-eastern food tour hosted by
Stephanie of Frying Pan Adventures. Stephanie is an Italian-Egyptian
native of Dubai. She took us around her old neighborhood where we
sampled food from Lebanon, Palestine, Egypt, Iran and Iraq. Jane and I
agreed that our favorite was the giant Felafel sandwhich from Sultan
Dubai Felafel. Eaten outside in the company of new friends it was
delicious. We then followed it up with Kunafa served in the kitchen of
Qwaider al Nabulsi. Kunafa is made with butter, noodles, salty cheese,
and sugar syrup. Cooked in a large pan to a golden brown and served
fresh! It was awesome. We also were able to enjoy many different
varieties of Baklava along with an amazing cream sauce made from
Soaproot! The egyptian pizza known as Feteer was also very good. My
least favorite was the slow smoked carp at the Iranian restaurant.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6168977ed8.jpg" alt="Making the Kunafa!"></p>
<p>This visit to Dubai has left us with more questions than answers but we
look forward to exploring much more of the middle eastern and southeast
asian cultures as we begin the cruise portion of the journey.</p>

<p>Its a misty late October morning, the farmers market isn&rsquo;t open yet,
and the Liverpool Cardiff match is on the TV. Below us the runners for
the Halloween half are spread out on West River Road. We are a little
sleepy as it was 11:30 by the time we got home from &ldquo;Beautiful&rdquo; the
Carol King story playing at the Orpheum. We love our city life!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/be60b116a0.jpg" alt="We love our view of the Stone ArchBridge!"></p>
<p>We moved in on September 24 and the rain started on the 25th and
continued for two and a half weeks. But once the weather cleared up we
have taken advantage of some clear fall days to discover our new
neighborhood. A bike trail across the road leads to the &ldquo;Dinky Town
Greenway&rdquo; which gives us a clear path to walk to TCF stadium in under
30 minutes! I swear we have waited that long to get out of the parking
lot after a Loons game in the past! Even better were these views taken
on a sunset walk home. We love our city life!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/748e8a9b98.jpg" alt="Sunset view of the 35W bridge from the old Northern Pacific railroadbridge"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e0dc80c49d.jpg" alt="Looking the other way at the Washington Ave.Bridge"></p>
<p>Everything in downtown is walkable, but within a few blocks we have Thai
restaurants, great breweries/brew pubs, fine dining, the Guthrie
theater, and so much more. There is even a giant stadium, should we ever
renew our interest in the Vikings. By bike its less than 10 minutes to
the computer science building at the University of Minnesota. With
access to hundreds of miles of bike trails right out our back door, I
can&rsquo;t wait for warmer weather. I&rsquo;ve biked over to Macalester for a
lecture and I&rsquo;m looking forward to attending talks and colloquia at the
U of M.</p>
<p>Our 1500 square feet is perfect for our needs. A den for me to use as my
office and reading area, an awesome kitchen and a nice living room for
sitting or watching TV. In the morning the shared workout room is an
awesome place to workout and watch the sun light up the IDS and Wells
Fargo buildings.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/04e1b392ed.jpg" alt="Our new Kitchen is awesome"></p>

<p>Jane and I have been slowly reconnecting with friends, family, and
former students from around the twin cities, and we look forward to
continuing that trend after we get back from upcoming travels. We have
enjoyed overnight visits from some of our Decorah friends with more
visits to breweries and even an awesome escape room last weekend.
Although I&rsquo;ve been super busy with Runestone Interactive and Google, I
am looking forward to some downtime and travel in a week. I left
graduation at Luther in May and flew to Mountain View the same day! The
following day I was hard at work on site at Google! Its been 40+ hour
weeks ever since. Speaking of travel, we already love the fact that we
will be able to take our bags and make the short walk to the light rail
to the airport. No parking, and no home maintenance worries while we are
away.</p>

<p>The plan was to go to Napa. But we have been to Napa in fact we had been
to Napa already this year. So instead we decided to try Yosemite. Its a
lot further drive from Mountain View but we love our national parks and
so this was a nice chance to take a long weekend break and visit
someplace we had never visited before.</p>
<p>As with most visits to a national park words don&rsquo;t do it justice and
neither do my pictures, but here goes.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/eb28c2823e.jpg" alt="The trail head at Mariposa Grove"></p>
<p>After a seemingly endless drive in traffic to get out of Mountain View
and especially someplace called &ldquo;Old Gilroy&rdquo; we spent our first night
in Oakville. We arrived late, but just in time to get the last Pizza of
the night from the friendly proprietor of Sugar Pine Pizza. We were
ready to set off for Mariposa grove in the morning to see the giant
redwoods.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/59c61c781d.jpg" alt="The Grizzly Giant"></p>
<p>From there we drove out to glacier point where we had a magnificent view
of Half Dome. This is definitely one of the highlights of Yosemite. It
is truly amazing, and the drop off from glacier point to the valley
floor below is really breathtaking.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/04b9953f0b.jpg" alt="Half Dome from Glacier Point"></p>
<p>We did a short hike at Glacier Point and then drove back and made a stop
at the Sentinel Dome trailhead. This would be our good hike for the day.
We wondered at first if we could really get to the top of Sentinel dome
but we found that we could and the views were definitely worth it. We
were really tired after the hike and more than happy to check in to the
Majestic Yosemite Inn. Right there on the floor of the valley we had
views of Half dome and El Capitan! Because it was early fall the
waterfalls were basically dried up so now we have a reason to go back
again some spring!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f4f11e2063.jpg" alt="The view from Sentinel Dome"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e1eb5f39b6.jpg" alt="Sentinel Dome Selfie"></p>
<p>The next morning we planned on hiking to mirror lake to see the morning
views of Half Dome reflected in the clear calm waters. Umm... Little
did we know that mirror lake is becoming a Meadow. Its part of the
natural order of things, but it was a little disappointing after hiking
two miles to find no water! Usually we are so good at researching these
things!</p>
<p>We had plenty of day left so we decided to make the drive to the Hetch
Hetchy Reservoir. It has some good hiking too although we only did a
little as it was super hot when we got there. The reservoir is beautiful
and its amazing to think that this reservoir supplies drinking water to
San Francisco.</p>

			 <p>The following is the transcript of my chapel talk.  You may be able to view it <a href="https://portal.stretchinternet.com/lutheradmin/portal.htm?eventId=447260&amp;streamType=video">here</a>.</p>
<p>Luke 24:   Now that same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. 14 They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.</p>
<p>The reading for today tells of a journey, and two friends talking about everything that had happened.  So, thats my plan for today.  Although I started my journey at Luther in Fall of 1982 as a skinny freshman,  I thought I would skip over 20 years and begin in the Fall of 2002.  After a successful career in industry, I felt called to come to Luther and share my experience.  I had come to campus and gone through the interview process, I’d given my interview talk to a packed house in Olin 112.  All I really remember from that talk was that the room was hot and as I looked over my audience I saw my revered former professor Steve Hubbard nodding off in the back row.</p>
<p>Despite putting Steve to sleep I thought things went well, and now back in Plymouth MN Jane and I are waiting on pins and needles to hear something from Dean Craft.  Coming to Luther to teach had been my dream since I was a junior here at Luther back in 1985.  So you can imagine the anxiety level was pretty high.  After a few extra days of waiting we threw modern theology to the wind and prayed for the lord to send us a sign!  A burning bush, a cloud shaped like a Norse head, anything!  The next day I received an email from a colleague at the University of Minnesota.  Brad, just wanted to let you know that Gustavus is going to be starting a search for a tenure track position in computer science.  Wrong sign! I shouted.  A day later the phone rang and it was Bill Craft calling with the offer.</p>
<p>In my ideas and creations post a week ago I wrote about 3 teachers on my journey  who inspired me, challenged me, and changed me.  My high school teacher Mr. Weinman who knew nothing about computers  but went way out of his way to encourage a couple of nerdy teens to teach themselves to program inspires me to bring teaching resources to other high school teachers.  My Luther Professor, Walt Will,  who inspired me to become a professor in the first place.  My master’s advisor, John Carlis  who challenged me to write a textbook when I told him I was going home to Luther College.</p>
<p>Of course, the journey to Emmaus is not just about a couple guys on a hike, the next line of the reading tells of a stranger that joined them on their road and started chatting with them.  When I look back on my years here at Luther it will be the journeys and encounters with strangers  that became new colleagues and friends that I remember most.</p>
<p>I have come to really love teaching students off campus.  My first  study away trip — a trip to Silicon Valley that I have done five times now — came about because an alumni wanted to teach a course on entrepreneurship. We hurriedly put the course together over November and December, and recruited 8 students&hellip; but over the Christmas break I added a last minute addition to the itinerary.  Jane and I were sitting at the Chefs table on a cruise ship and I was chatting with the stranger next to me.  I was telling him about the upcoming course which he thought sounded fantastic.  Then he dropped a bombshell, he said he worked at Pixar!  And, although visiting groups are not usually allowed he thought he could arrange something for us!  He was true to his word, and that visit turned out to be one of the real highlights of the course that year.</p>
<p>Probably my favorite semester of all time at Luther will be the semester Jane and I spent with a dozen students in Malta.  We had 10 young women in the group who we very quickly began to refer to as our daughters.  We were very fortunate to get to travel with these students to Istanbul, Rome and Morocco.  It was in Marrakech , as we were walking down the street with one of our daughters that we were approached by a stranger.   I’ll give you two camels for your beautiful daughter he said with a smile and a wink.    Wait here! I said, I have 9 more daughters back at the Riad.  Some days I like to imagine the life I could have had as a camel rancher had I taken that stranger up on his offer.   A small postscript to this story:  After writing the rough draft of this talk I walked out to get the mail.  Only to find a thank you note from this very daughter.  It said “My husband and I are moving to Texas.  and I wouldn’t be ready for this next adventure if it hadn’t been for the journey’s with you two.”</p>
<p>It was on that same trip to Morocco that we had an amazing day-long journey, from Fez through the middle Atlas Mountains  - where we had a snowball fight and fed the monkeys - to the edge of the Sahara, where we boarded camels and road into the desert.  Watching the sun set over the desert is one of the most beautiful and awe inspiring sights any of us had ever seen.  That night — with no WiFi or Cell service — our Berber hosts cooked us a Tagine of beef and we sat outside with them where they played drums and sang traditional Berber songs for us.  We treated them to a rendition of &ldquo;To Luther&rdquo; and We will Rock You!  That night changed us all.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you are on a journey, it is the unplanned things that can surprise you the most.  During our stop at Ait Ben Haddou we made a dinner time decision to extend our stay so that we could visit the Ksar - The fortified city.  At breakfast, Mohammed, the owner of the Hotel Bagdhad Cafe was happy to line up a guide, also named Mohammed, for us at the last minute, giving him an unconditional recommendation as the best guide in town.</p>
<p>At about the midway point of our climb through the Ksar our guide stopped outside his own house. &ldquo;You are welcome here&rdquo; he said. This is a phrase we had heard everywhere in Morocco from many different people.  It had a much different feel than &ldquo;welcome to my place.” it is at once more personal, more authentic, and unconditional.  In a place where we wondered whether we really would be welcome we found it very comforting.  Maybe thats a phrase we could think about adopting here at Luther.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the tour we came upon a mosque which is still in daily use. Right next to the mosque was a synagogue, no longer in use. The history of the Berber people is very old, and interesting. At one time the majority of the Berber&rsquo;s were Jewish, then for a time they were Christian, but they have been Muslim for a long time.  The result for the Berbers is that they are peaceful, and very tolerant.  We want to get along with all people Mohammed told us. He went on, the problems in the world today are caused by three things: money, politics, and crazy people &ndash; Crazy Jews, Crazy Muslims, and Crazy Christians. Most people are good and peaceful people, its a shame the crazy people have to ruin it.</p>
<p>So, as I reach the end of my journey as a Luther faculty member I have much to be thankful for and I look forward to the future with excitement.  A little over a week ago I was sitting on a plane, flying back from San Francisco.  The stranger seated next to me on this journey struck up a conversation which surprisingly lasted the entire three hour flight back to Minneapolis.  He had worked at Cargill for 17 years in their Malt division and had just recently made a long hoped for career change to become a financial planner.  I told him about my career path and that I too was making a change and was on my way back after two days of meetings with my new team at Google.  An offer had come to join this group for six months through a connection with a colleague I have only worked with online.  We have written a paper together,  we have written software together and done a joint podcast.  I wrote him a letter of recommendation for his current job at UCSD.  With this group I’ll get to do exactly what I was planning to do all along which is to work on Runestone Interactive — democratizing textbooks for the 21st century.  Only now I’ll get a bit of help which may in turn help more “Mr. Weinman’s” out there.</p>
<p>Somewhere over southwest Minnesota this stranger said to me “Wow, You’ve had an amazing journey!”  I guess you just have to keep your eyes open and be open to new opportunities when they come along.</p>
<p>So my advice to you students is to look for those strangers, take the time to chat with them and welcome them along on your journey.  You never know where it might lead.</p>

			 <p>As this will be my final Ideas and Creations contribution I hope you will indulge me in a little look back over my relationship with Luther College and the teachers and professors that have made me who I am today.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/d24cce6534.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The first person I want to mention is the man in the picture &ndash; Charlie Weinman,  with the hairstyle and the vest you might guess this picture comes from the early 80&rsquo;s.  Mr. Weinman taught typing and shorthand at Luverne High School. The picture shows him in a typical pose, and I can hear his exasperated sigh at my inability to keep my eyes off the keyboard as I worked on my &ldquo;perfect paragraphs.&rdquo;  Mr Weinman was the advisor to the annual staff as well, and his favorite saying, which I heard often, was “If you want something done right, ask a busy person”  Somewhere along the way Mr. Weinman noticed that  one of the reasons I was always so busy was because my friend and I spent an inordinate amount of time messing around on the Apple II computers our high school had just purchased.  We were teaching ourselves to program and trading games on cassette tapes. He made it his mission to help and encourage us — with the programming part.  On weekends he would drive us to programming contests all around Southwest Minnesota.  He eventually created the first programming class at the high school.  The deal was that my friends and I could take the class so we could get credit and have it on our transcript, but we were to sit in the back and keep quiet &ndash; unless he asked for our help.</p>
<p>As I look back on it Mr Weinman was modeling a key aspect of a Luther education — life long learning.  He also demonstrated to us  with great humor and humility that teachers don&rsquo;t always have all the answers.  This was a good lesson, as even today in my final semester I&rsquo;m faced every day with the fact that I don&rsquo;t have all the answers when teaching machine learning or internet programming.  The world of computer science moves far to quickly for any of us to know it all, and we must be prepared to be lifelong learners if we are going to succeed in this field.</p>
<h2 id="walt-will">Walt Will</h2>
<p>When I arrived at Luther in the fall of 1982 I became a Norseman.  It was only year two for the Norsemen, but the foundations that were laid for this group in 1981 are still strong today.  Norsemen may be the only connection I have to some classmates, but I would still consider them my brothers.  It was probably my classmate,  Tim Peter, who came walking down the hall of first floor Ylvi encouraging those of us who were clueless to come to tryouts for this relatively unknown group!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/772d2330ba.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>As a computer science major I was fortunate to take the majority of my classes from Dr. Walt Will.  Walt was my professor, my advisor and a great role model.   He had a wonderful dry humor and an endless supply of patience to answer my endless stream of questions in class or to just sit in his office and talk about computer science and life in general.  In the spirit of life long learning we always knew that Walt was just ahead of us (if only by a few days)  in our journey through this new field of computer science together.</p>
<p>Walt was such a huge influence that when people would ask me about my career goals I would say &ldquo;I want to come back to Luther and take Walt Will&rsquo;s job.”  That sounds a little harsh to my older self, but I meant it as the highest possible compliment to Walt.   I really felt that success in life would be to have the kind of impact on other students that Walt had on us. After 18 years in the computer science industry, it was ultimately Walt who paved the way for my return to Luther as a faculty member.   I remember a phone call with Walt when he told me he would be only too happy to move back to the Math department to create a position in computer science in 2003.  As I started my new career as a professor I was very lucky to have Walt down the hall to talk with and get advice.  As I’ve grown professor I&rsquo;ve learned that I have to be myself, I&rsquo;ll never be Walt, I definitely don&rsquo;t have his patience.</p>
<h2 id="john-carlis">John Carlis</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/00b95a6824.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>If you would have asked the 1990 version of Brad Miller what it was like to be a grad student at the University of Minnesota,  it would not have been a positive conversation.  Going from small-town Minnesota and Luther College to the U was a huge culture shock!  Big classes, registration lines that stretched down the stairs and around the block, professors that closed the doors to their office, it was all very foreign.   However, I would have told you about one professor that would be right at home at Luther and that was Dr. John Carlis.  I was fortunate enough to take a class from John which changed everything and led to him becoming my masters advisor and friend.  After a time or two of stopping by his office to ask questions about assignments he started making me coffee and we started talking about teaching and research and writing a one-draft thesis and singing and parenting.</p>
<p>John had a great sense of humor and was famous for his bad puns.  He would take two dimes out of his pocket and put them in the palm of his hand and slowly move his hand back and forth.  &ldquo;Do you know what this is?&rdquo; He would ask, &ldquo;a pair-a-dime shift!&rdquo;  Although I switched advisors for my PhD project I never stopped having coffee and conversation with John.  When I told him about coming to Luther to teach he encouraged me to write a textbook, embrace the liberal arts, and get to know people outside of CS.  At his funeral a few weeks ago I heard my story over and over from lots of former students.  John had this same kind of relationship with countless students over the years, always having the right story or the right word of encouragement at the right time. His office must have had some kind of magical time vortex because I&rsquo;ll never know how he could spend this much time with so many different people.  As I look back, I do not know whether I would have become a U of M graduate if had not been fortunate enough to know John Carlis.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/50b8070e65.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>John&rsquo;s advice also shaped my experience as a faculty member at Luther.  Some of my favorite experiences as a faculty member come out of embracing the liberal arts:  teaching Paideia 450s with my friend Jim Martin-Schramm,  leading the Malta program, leading JTerm courses in Silicon Valley, helping to create the Data Science major are all experiences I will remember for the rest of my life.  The process of writing two paper textbooks led to the vision that has become Runestone Interactive.  My JTerm students will be happy to know that Runestone now has a mantra:  &ldquo;Democratizing textbooks for the 21st century.&rdquo;  As I leave Luther I am super excited that I can devote my full focus and energy to Runestone., which today serves 20,000 students a day at both high schools and colleges!  I hope to make that 2 million students  in the next few years.</p>
<p>In the face of declining enrollments, ratio imbalances, committee meetings and  program reductions its easy to forget why we do what we do.  I came to Luther 15 years ago because I felt called to share my experience and make a difference in the lives of students; just as Charlie Weinman, Walt Will, and John Carlis have made a difference in mine.  I hope I have.  My relationship with Luther is long and varied, I’m an alumni, a donor, a faculty member and a parent of an alum.  If Luther calls sometime in the future to ask me to serve in some other capacity, I hope that I can.  Soli Deo Gloria.</p>

			 <p>Fortunately one of the courses that I did register for was Introduction to Database Systems, taught by John Carlis.  Shortly after classes started and we were well into discussing herds of cows and various creatures and their skills and creating LDSs I found myself searching out his office to ask him some question about homework.  Once in his office we started talking, and then he made me a cup of coffee.  The conversation went well beyond drawing LDSs &ndash; we discovered that we both liked to sing &ndash;  and he invited me to stop back again.  Soon I was stopping in his office just to chat and get a cup of coffee.  Research meetings and a TA position followed.  John became my advisor and my friend and he gave me the gift of a sense of belonging. As I look back, I wonder if I would have stayed without the cups of coffee and conversation in John&rsquo;s office.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>When our first Child was born, he gave us a present.  He had cut out and painted the letters to spell  our daughters name in his shop.  We talked about his own daughters and the challenges and joys of being a father.</p>
<p>Even years later, after I had shifted my focus to Grouplens, and started a company, he always welcomed me back.  He was still on my PhD committee, a thing he liked to remind me of frequently, especially when he wanted me to review something.  &ldquo;Can you do this?  I&rsquo;m still on your committee right?&rdquo;  He would say with a grin.</p>
<p>I learned about building a fence around your thesis, and writing a one-draft draft thesis.  When I decided that teaching at a small college was in my future he gave me a copy of Mager&rsquo;s book and we talked about instructional objectives and how to become a good teacher.</p>
<p>Before I left for Luther College he gave me another piece of advice that I will never forget.  &ldquo;Write a text book,&rdquo; he told me.  At a small college that is a good way to publish and it will tie directly to your teaching.  Two years into my time at Luther I asked my department head, &ldquo;would you like to write a book with me?&rdquo;  He agreed and we found ourselves publishing the first data structures textbook using the Python programming language.  After that we wrote an introductory book on programming with Python.</p>
<p>As I prepare to leave Luther and move into a new project of building a sustainable small business around the Runestone Interactive textbook project I can trace the evolution of this research and writing right back to John.  The project now serves over 20,000 students a day around the world, and I frequently hear the echo of his advice in my head as I work on designing new chapters and writing new examples, and building new lessons.</p>
<p>Thank you John, for all the advice, the coffee, and the friendship!  More students that you will ever know have benefitted from your wisdom and hospitality.</p>

			 <p>Whenever I teach this JTerm course on entrepreneurship, friends and colleagues often ask me &ldquo;do you miss it?&rdquo;  Meaning do I miss the business world.  The answer has always been, &ldquo;yes, but I love teaching even more.&rdquo;  This year the answer is different, this year the answer is&hellip; &ldquo;yes, and I&rsquo;m excited to tell you that I&rsquo;m leaving Luther to start a new company!&rdquo;  Spring Semester of 2018 will be my last semester as a full time faculty member at Luther. I have accepted the separation agreement offered by Luther, and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to the next chapter in my life and career!</p>
<p>This was not an easy decision &ndash; I have enjoyed my time at Luther, and Jane and I could not have asked for a better place to raise our family. JTerm is always a powerful reminder of how great our students are, and how much I enjoy getting to know them beyond the classroom.  But, Kaia and Josh have both graduated from college, Kaia is married, in grad school, with a house, and three dogs in Sioux Falls, Josh has a great girlfriend, and a job he likes in Wisconsin.  In short, they are launched (yay us!).</p>
<p>We are ready for the next phase of our lives.  So, the house in Decorah is for sale and we have a down payment on a condo in downtown Minneapolis! We close and move in September of 2018! The bike trails are out the back door, we have a view of the Stone Arch bridge, the Guthrie is three blocks away, the light rail to the new MNUFC (Loons) stadium is a four block walk!  It is a 15 minute bike ride to our friends Brian and Holly for happy hour!  What could be better? &ndash; Well, if we could convince a few Decorah friends to move to Minneapolis that would be perfect, but we try not to be greedy.</p>
<h2 id="runestone-interactive-llc">Runestone Interactive, LLC</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So, this January I&rsquo;ve been listening very closely and thinking about how all of these great stories and advice apply to a guy in his mid-50&rsquo;s.  I&rsquo;m leaving a tenured faculty position, at a college I love dearly to start a new company.  Here is what I take away.</p>
<p>We heard the following from a lot of different people: &ldquo;follow your passion!&rdquo;  Well, I admit I&rsquo;ve told my students this many many times (although I could write a full post on the perils of telling 19 year olds that they need a passion.)  But I have to say that for as much as I enjoy teaching at Luther College,  <a href="http://runestoneinteractive.org">Runestone Interactive</a> has definitely become a <strong>passion.</strong>  Runestone has grown from a small project for 30 Luther students few years ago, to supporting over 20,000 students each day from over 600 institutions around the world. This growth has all happened through word of mouth.  No advertising, No booths at trade shows, no sales force, no full time development team!  I really think that Runestone could be 2,000,000 students a day with focus and full time effort. &ndash; Yes, former students, that is what I think about in the shower in the morning!</p>
<p>The separation incentive offered by Luther gives me the opportunity to start a new company, incorporating what I learned from all the mistakes I made the first time around with Net Perceptions, and all of the experience I&rsquo;ve gained in the last 15 years of teaching.  It gives me <strong>one year</strong> to figure out if there is a business model that will keep the basic features and the books of Runestone free to everyone, while allowing me to build a small business that pays a salary, and hopefully allows me to bring others on board to work on this with me.  It allows me to (1) follow a passion, (2) make the world a better place and (3) to play my part in &ldquo;righting the wrong&rdquo; that is textbook publishing today.  Yes, $300 for a paperback textbook is a wrong!  Wow, count them, that is three awesome reasons to start a company!</p>
<h2 id="democratizing-textbooks-for-the-21supstsup-century">Democratizing Textbooks for the 21<!-- raw HTML omitted -->st<!-- raw HTML omitted --> Century</h2>
<p>In our discussions of Guy Kawasaki&rsquo;s books during JTerm we talked about companies needing a mantra.  I think that the Mantra for Runestone is &ldquo;Democratizing textbooks for the 21<!-- raw HTML omitted -->st<!-- raw HTML omitted --> century&rdquo;. This could be another whole post, but I&rsquo;ll just say that there is a huge need for computer scientists and there are a lot of well meaning, (but potentially under-prepared) teachers out there who we can help teach computer science.  This is true at the high-school level where computer science is getting traction again, as well as many small colleges where it is almost impossible to find a computer science PhD who is willing to work for what small colleges can pay.</p>
<p>The second piece of Runestone is in the interactive nature of the books.  Textbooks should not be static, read-only, words.  Textbooks in the 21<!-- raw HTML omitted -->st<!-- raw HTML omitted --> century should engage the reader in interactive learning.  Textbooks should also give instructors insight into what their students understand and what their students are struggling with&hellip; Textbooks should help answer the question &ldquo;How can I maximize my time in the classroom today?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="get-uncomfortable">Get Uncomfortable</h2>
<p>We heard a lot about seeking opportunities that make you uncomfortable.  It is through these uncomfortable experiences that you grow.  For the last 15 years this has happened through teaching (especially new courses), and traveling to new places (many times with students) and experiencing new cultures.  Leaving my faculty position &ndash; where I have almost total job security &ndash; is definitely a move in an uncomfortable direction.  Especially for someone over the age of 50. But, I am convinced this is the right thing to do.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-culture-charting-your-own-course">Creating a culture, charting your own course</h2>
<p>We heard from a lot of people that had worked in both large and small companies about how great it was to be part of a small organization. in a startup, everything you do is important.  From making the coffee in the morning, to setting strategic direction.  <strong>I get that</strong>. I remember those early days from Net Perceptions.  I miss those days. I miss that sense of ownership for the whole enterprise. The &ldquo;shared governance&rdquo; model used by most small colleges is about as far from agile as you can get.</p>
<p>This course reminded me, yet again, why I admire Jeff Bezos and the culture he has built at Amazon.  I was blown away that all of the young people we spoke with at Amazon understood and could talk about many, if not all of,  the 14 leadership principles.  If you don&rsquo;t know them here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Amazon&rsquo;s Leadership Principles</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Customer Obsession</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ownership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invent and Simplify</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are Right, a Lot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn and be Curious</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hire and Develop the Best</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insist on the Highest Standards</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think Big</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bias for Action</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frugality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earn Trust</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dive Deep</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deliver Results</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get more detail on each of them <a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/principles">here</a>.  But I can only fantasize what a great company Runestone would be if I put these into action.  I also think that higher-ed could benefit from all of these principles, but the conditions are so hard to make this happen!</p>
<p>So as I finish up this post, I have a week until Spring Semester classes begin.  Am I sad that this is my last semester?  Of course! Luther College is such an integral part of my life &ndash; I&rsquo;m an alumni, a parent of an alumni, a faculty member, and a donor.  I&rsquo;ll only be losing one of those four tags.  I look forward to finding new ways that I can serve the college in the future.  I&rsquo;ll also miss the students and all of the energy they bring.  I&rsquo;ll miss watching them grow and develop into the successful entrepreneurs, developers, and managers that so many of them have become.  In the meantime, I&rsquo;m going to enjoy my final semester to the max.  I get to teach two of my favorite classes, and I&rsquo;m eliminating non-essential committee work to go out on a high note!</p>

			 <p>The students are on the plane home, and I am now in Napa taking a few days of R&amp;R and thinking about what <strong>I learned</strong> during the month of January.  TLDR &ndash; Lots!  But the two things I would like to focus on are the answers to the questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What can we do better to prepare our students for the real world in the computer science department at Luther College?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What stands out the most <em>to me</em> from all our meetings?  This  was also a question that some of our hosts asked of the students in the closing days of the course; and one I hope they will reflect on in their final papers.  So, it seems only fair that I do the same.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ll do this in two parts.  This is part I.</p>
<p><img src="images/redwood_hike.png" alt="Redwood Hike"></p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-luther-cs-dept-do-better">How can we (Luther CS dept) do better?</h2>
<p>One of the best things about this trip was the number of alumni we got to meet with, several of whom are alumni of this course. I&rsquo;ll take a brief diversion to brag a bit &ndash; We have alumni at Amazon, Microsoft, YouTube and Google.  We have alumni at small companies like SafeGraph and Benetech.  All of them were super gracious to meet and host this latest group.</p>
<p>Another standout lesson revolves around continually improving.  We heard lots of great testimonials for &ldquo;lifelong learning&rdquo;. I think this is one of the consistent themes I&rsquo;ve heard at Luther over my 15 years at the college.  As a department, I think that is one of the things we have done well over the years too.  Asking the question regularly about how we can improve.</p>
<p>We asked the Luther alumns a couple of questions each time we met with one.    What advice do you have for the students as they move on from Luther?  What do you wish you had learned at Luther that you did not?</p>
<p>The answer to the second question was nearly unanimous, and quite surprising to me.  It is just two words:  <strong>Unit Testing.</strong>  How interesting, I don&rsquo;t know that I had an answer that I was expecting, but it certainly wasn&rsquo;t that.  But as I reflect on other things we heard it makes sense.</p>
<p>Companies are definitely trending away from the development team  composed of X number of developers and k*X number of QA people.  Now, testing is part of everyone&rsquo;s job and unit tests are a big part of that.  I think there are a number of ways that we can incorporate this into our curriculum at Luther.  The Runestone textbook already uses unit tests to automatically grade a lot of  assignments.  But I think adding them to project based courses like Internet Programming and even the Sr. Project will go a long way toward helping students learn to write and use unit tests.  The biggest obstacle is helping them understand the why.</p>
<p>One of the wisest things I heard on the trip came from a young engineer at Amazon who said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to remember that unit tests are not for you &ndash; you know your code works.  Unit tests are for the people who come after you and have to make changes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have been thinking a lot about unit testing lately as I think it has been a real hinderance to the Runestone project.  People who contribute to open source want to know that they are not breaking your stuff, and the best way to help them over that hurdle is to have a big suite of unit tests.  My new years resolution, which I&rsquo;m doing pretty well on, is to write a unit test every day until June.</p>
<p>Its not just newcomers either, its also me in my role as maintainer.  When someone comes with a cool new feature that also changes a bunch of existing code I get seriously anxious.  After all, there are people (teachers and students) that rely on this to work, and I hate to disappoint.</p>
<p>If you are a former student and are reading this I would love to hear from you.  Do you agree?  What else?  What do you think is the best way we can incorporate unit testing into the curriculum?</p>
<p>In Part II I&rsquo;ll talk about my own takeaways from our three weeks.</p>

<p>Its been six or eight years since I&rsquo;ve taken a group of students to the
Computer History Museum, and am I ever glad that I made the stop this
time. The museum has changed a lot over the years and this was by far
the best visit ever.</p>
<p>The first part of the &ldquo;ancient&rdquo; history of computing (up to the late
1970&rsquo;s) was really well done, but I noticed that I couldn&rsquo;t stop
myself from snapping pictures of computers from then on. I realized that
I was in fact taking pictures of the machines that I have personally
worked on or used for fun over the years.</p>

<p>Did you ever play tank battle on one of these? I think its safe to say
that this was the first game console I ever used. Notice the lovely
woodgrain finish, and the switch to change between black and white and
color TVs!</p>
<h2 id="apple-ii">Apple II</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/051a1d7268.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>The Apple II was the first computer I ever programmed. Lets face it, if
you couldn&rsquo;t write a little basic, the Apple II was pretty useless. I
first encountered the Apple II in the AV room of my high school in the
spring of my Freshman year in 1979. I never looked back. Hacking the
Lemonade Stand game was my first stab at modifying someone else&rsquo;s code.</p>

<p>Of course this is the computer I wanted for my own. It was less
expensive than the Apple, black and white and ran BASIC.</p>

<p>Luverne high school, like many schools ofthe day, was connected to MECC
(Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium) By 300 baud modem we
connected to a big CDC computer running somewhere in the twin cities. We
could play Star Trek against other high school students or use a
primitive chat program where, even in 1980, every third high school girl
went by an online name of &ldquo;FoxyLady&rdquo; Of course back than it was
FOXYLADY as lower case characters were not invented yet. This particular
specimin actually only ran at 110 baud and was pretty much out of use by
the tie I got into high school Using this seemed like a huge pain, but
at least I can say that I missed the card punch era! Beyond basic on the
AppleII we could write programs in Pascal on the MECC computers.</p>

<p>When I got to Luther College and went to my first General Physics lab,
these were the computers that greeted us. Programmable in basic, and
easy to interface to simple lab equipment using the basic commands PEEK
and POKE to set and read memory locations that were mapped to the I/O
devices. We could also use the PET computers to do accurate timing, as
long as you were able to convert from the unit of a &ldquo;Jiffy&rdquo; to
seconds. As I recall there were 60 Jiffies in a second.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e5cea7a54a.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>I never actually used a Data General computer, but during my first year
of college I read Tracy Kidder&rsquo;s book <em>The Soul of a New Machine</em>, this
book had such a huge influence on me, it totally cemented my career path
toward computer computer science. I loved this book so much that I kept
it and had it in my office atLuther after I became a professor. When
Kidder came to Luther to give the opening convocation speech a few years
ago to talk about his latest book <em>Mountains beyond Mountains</em>, I was
able to meet him and have him autograph my 30+ year old paperback. He
actually looked quite surprised that I had a paperback that old.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cf41e65be9.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Another early computer I encountered at Luther, in the MRI lab, was an
LSI-11, this was the Heathkit replica of this PDP-11. The lab had an
even older PDP-8 but the museum didn&rsquo;t have one of those.</p>
<h2 id="commodore-64">Commodore 64</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/94ab990604.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>What I worked on the most in the MRI lab at Luther was a Commodore64. We
had a cartridge version of the programming language FORTH that I used to
write a program to collect data from the Analog to Digital Converter. I
remember being shocked that we were using this incredibly inexpensive
computerto control a $10,000 data collection device.</p>
<h2 id="apollo">Apollo</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4af2deaf78.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>In the summer of 1985 I had the amazing opportunity to do an internship
at Amoco research center in Tulsa Oklahoma. I was tasked with writing
benchmarks to test various implementations of Lisp for the IBM PC. I
remember that I had the first PC/AT in the building. But more
interesting was my friend Jay&rsquo;s Apollo. I think we called this
mini-computers back then, today we would think of them as workstations.
What I remember most about the Apollo was the speed of it, and the
graphics capabilities! This was the very early days of windows and mice,
and I recall that Jay had a program that he could start up on the Apollo
that would make it look like chunks of your display were breaking loose
and falling to the bottom of your screen. It was hilarious the first
time it happened to us. That summer was also my first exposure to using
a 3270 green screen terminal. Sadly I didn&rsquo;t seen one at the computer
history museum.</p>

<p>Jay also had a Lisa in his home office! I couldn&rsquo;t wait to graduate and
make some money so I could have one of my own. Of course by the time
Jane and I got married just a year later the Lisa was a thing of the
past and so we got a Mac Plus instead! I still have this computer in my
office at Luther. It still boots from a floppy and runs Microsoft&rsquo;s
flight simulator.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1462fe4082.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>When I started work at Control Data&rsquo;s Energy Management Systems
division in 1986 I was awed by the giant cooled computer room. There
were lots of giant water cooled Cyber computers in there for the newer
customers, but amongst all of those newere Cybers was this little old
CDC6600 computer than was running an older version of the software. If
it scares you that our electrical grid was controlled by one of these
don&rsquo;t worry, they were solid work horses for many years. What I
remember most about the 6600 was that there was a little program that
made the two CRT&rsquo;s look like eyes, and then one of them would wink at
you.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c20885f36d.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>After a couple of years at CDC I managed to manuever my way into an AI
group. A lot of high-end AI programming was done in Lisp in those days
and the Symbolics was <em>the</em> machine to have if you really wanted to do
it.</p>
<h2 id="silicon-graphics">Silicon Graphics</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/41a2c0ea87.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Shortly after the Symbolics we switched to running more general purpose
Unix workstations. CDC was reselling SGI computers under the label of
&ldquo;Personal Iris&rdquo; I taught myself some very early graphics in what
eventually became OpenGL on these machines. This began a life long love
of using Unix. I spent many extra hours on the Iris compiling emacs and
other early open source programs.</p>
<h2 id="the-palm-pilot">The Palm Pilot</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/112219e461.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>The last bit of nostalgia I captured at the museum was this first
generation Palm Pilot! I remember that when Net Perceptions officially
launched our product it was at the Agenda conference in Phoenix Arizona.
They were also launching the Palm Pilot at that same conference. What I
remember most about this was the brilliant marketing they did. First,
they had preloaded a bunch of Palm Pilots with the conference schedule.
Second, they had a bunch of &ldquo;old ladies&rdquo; demonstrating how easy they
were to use. They showed you the Grafiti writing system, how to add
meetings, and they took your credit card with the promise that you could
use one for the duration of the conference and if you didn&rsquo;t want it
after that they wouldn&rsquo;t charge your card. I&rsquo;m pretty sure every
single person kept theirs. This was the first of a very long line of
PDAs that I have owned over the years. I could probably do a whole post
just on those.</p>
<p>Visiting the Computer History Museum was educational, and a great trip
down memory lane for me. If you are ever in Mountain View and have a few
hours I would highly recommend you plan to spend couple hours exploring!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’ve been thinking about this question a lot lately and I know others have been repeating this question as we struggle through the strategic planning process.</p>
<p>It struck me the other day when one of my colleagues, a person I know worked on the current mission statement for Luther college, answered this question by referring to the mission statement.  I guess it never occurred to me that reasonable people would consider this a settled question due to the existence of a “mission statement.”  Maybe that  is the case for some, but I think this is a question that needs to be revisited with some frequency, and the fact that this “who are we?” question keeps coming up over and over again, makes me think there is much more to talk about.</p>
<p>In an effort to make progress in my own mind I copied the mission statement reread it a couple of times, and decided to take it apart paragraph by paragraph to see if that helps me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the reforming spirit of Martin Luther, Luther College affirms the liberating power of faith and learning. As people of all backgrounds, we embrace diversity and challenge one another to learn in community, to discern our callings, and to serve with distinction for the common good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are the items from the first paragraph that stand out, and my take on them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Reforming Spirit</strong> — Yes we must always be in a reforming state of mind.  We can never say that we are good enough.  We must always be wondering whether we should change with the times or resist change for good cause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Faith and Learning</strong> — There is no getting around the fact that Luther is a college of the Lutheran church.  We need to define what that means.  I remember well, a conversation a friend (former Luther prof) and I had with a woman in a ski chalet in Colorado a couple of years ago.  She made a whole bunch of assumptions about what we were like because we were a “christian” college.  Lets just say that the fact that our student congregation is a reconciling in christ congregation would have made her head explode.  Yes we are a “christian” college but not a fundamentalist college.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Embrace Diversity</strong> — I think you might be hard pressed to find a major with more diversity than CS.  We have lots of international students from many different countries.  I think it is really important that we have a diverse student body, but I worry that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Define diversity too narrowly:  Race and ethnicity are important forms of diversity, but so too are differences based on class, political ideology, and gender/sex identity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to think through the implications of diversity carefully.  If increased diversity means more financial aid, and more student services to support an underprepared population then we need the financial resources to back that up or we are just setting ourselves up for disaster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Learning in community</strong> — I’m definitely an interactive learner, I need people to talk with and bounce ideas off of.  Interdisciplinary programs feel more like community to me, and I would like to see more of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Discern our callings</strong> — This is a Lutheran hallmark, and I miss the sense of vocation program and the emphasis that this brought.  I don’t think we ever have been or ever should be the kind of Liberal Arts college that says “don’t worry about jobs and outcomes, just study the humanities and you can do anything.”  That is not the kind of place students and parents are looking for in 2017.   It is OK for us to care about outcomes and careers and helping students find their calling and vocation in life.   It is also a real source of pride that Luther is the kind of place where a student can come and figure out who they are and what their calling is without getting lost in the shuffle.  Many times these discoveries happen because a professor makes a little extra effort at just the right time to really connect.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As a college of the church, Luther is rooted in an understanding of grace and freedom that emboldens us in worship, study, and service to seek truth, examine our faith, and care for all God’s people.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I didn’t really understand this one very well until my colleague Jim Martin-Schramm provided the following list in an email the other day:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lutheran higher education offers a third way between the polarities of sectarian fundamentalism versus purely secular education.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lutheran colleges see no contradiction between faith and intellectual freedom, which means no questions are considered off limits from vigorous debate and discussion—even questions about religion and the nature of God.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Lutheran doctrine of justification by grace through faith is the foundation for Luther College’s commitments to hospitality and inclusivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We are freed to question the most basic and even sacred assumptions because to do so deepens our understanding of the world and our place in it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A theological marker that defines Christianity in general, and Lutheranism in particular, is the notion of paradox, which enables us to resist dualistic, either/or ways of thinking and easy answers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While many understand vocation as a job or career, Lutherans understand vocation as a calling from God that encompasses all of life.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As a liberal arts college, Luther is committed to a way of learning that moves us beyond immediate interests and present knowledge into a larger world—an education that disciplines minds and develops whole persons equipped to understand and confront a changing society.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>What I hear in my head when I read this is:  <strong>Life-long learning</strong> — This is a big one for me, because its a way of life in my field.  We help our students build a solid foundation in computer science recognizing that much of what we teach them, at least in terms of specific technologies, will be obsolete in a few years.  They need to be equipped as lifelong learners, embracing all forms of learning including on-line as well as face to face.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As a residential college, Luther is a place of intersection. Founded where river, woodland, and prairie meet, we practice joyful stewardship of the resources that surround us, and we strive to be a community where students, faculty, and staff are enlivened and transformed by encounters with one another, by the exchange of ideas, and by the life of faith and learning.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Residential, but a place of intersection</strong> — I think this word intersection gets lost in the woodlands…. The real point of intersection is to encounter others and I would argue that in the 21st century we need to embrace encountering others in ALL ways.  Face to face as well as electronically.  As Friedman says, “the world is flat”, and its getting flatter.  In my own research work I routinely interact with people on other continents at all times of the day, through email, various forms of chat, and definitely face to face via Google hangouts or Apple FaceTime.   We need not fear that we will somehow destroy the residential nature of Luther college by integrating online learning as a way of enhancing and enriching the student experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Practice stewardship of our resources</strong> — I fully support our sustainability initiatives as well as our environmental studies program.  But to me we cannot lose site of the fact that the mission statement admonishes us to practice stewardship of our resources, which must include our financial resources. This means we need to think carefully about what programs should continue and what programs need investment and nurturing.  Just because we have had a program in place for some years does not mean that it should be here forever and always.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A community enlivened by the exchange of ideas</strong> — Its too bad this one comes last, because I think as faculty engaged in shared governance we need a lively exchange of ideas.  We cannot cast the administration in the role of “other” this governance cannot and should not be a we versus they contest.  We need to be able to disagree, maybe even sharply, but at the end of the day we need to come together and pull in the same direction.  If we can’t do that then we’ll tear the college apart.  The best groups I’ve ever worked in have had lots of disagreement — loud, marker-throwing disagreement even — but at the end of the discussion it was the best ideas that rose to the top and were implemented, and fully supported by everyone no matter what “side” they may have taken during discussion.  More, at the end of the day we saw each other as people and colleagues, not as representatives of a faction or rivals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This certainly is not the definitive answer to the question “who are we?”  Each of us will bring their own experiences and ideas to their own answer.  It was a fun exercise and I encourage you to give it a shot too!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I’m a fan of Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon,  whether its because he “got it” and was the first customer of Net Perceptions or because of his fascination with space or just because I admire him as a leader.  It doesn’t matter, I pay attention to what he has to say on a lot of things.</p>
<p>The building at Amazon where Jeff has his office is called Day 1, even when he moves to a new office he brings the name of the building with him.  This is because he is always reminding himself to act like it is Day 1.</p>
<p>This morning I read his latest letter to the shareholders of Amazon in which he was asked what does Day 2 look like. Here is his short answer:  “Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And <strong>that</strong> is why it is <strong>always</strong> Day 1.”</p>
<p>In the letter he goes on to expand upon his ideas for how to fend off Day 2.  I’ll give you his one sentence synopsis, and in the rest of this post I would like to share with you how I translate his ideas into the context of Luther College.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here’s a starter pack of essentials for Day 1 defense: customer obsession, a skeptical view of proxies, the eager adoption of external trends, and high-velocity decision making.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its not a surprise that customer obsession is number one on his list.  The amazon mission statement is pretty simple:  &ldquo;Our vision is to be earth&rsquo;s most customer-centric company; to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to buy online.&rdquo;  I am not a fan of viewing students as customers, but I think student success is a good substitute.  So here is a lightly edited version of what Bezos had to say,  plugging in student success where appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="obsess-about-student-success">Obsess About Student Success</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Staying in Day 1 requires you to experiment patiently, accept failures, plant seeds, protect saplings, and double down when you see student success.  A <strong>student success</strong> obsessed culture best creates the conditions where all of that can happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That statement pretty well sums up the lens through which I view the discussion we have had on campus lately regarding program eliminations and reductions and how we evolve as a liberal arts college in the 21st century.  We have to be bold and willing to try new programs at Luther.  But we must equally be willing to accept that something we have tried did not work as well as we had hoped, and when that happens we should move our resources somewhere else.  If we are student success focused then we can view moving on as a victory <strong>for the students</strong> rather than a defeat for a particular <strong>program of study.</strong> If we are <strong>student success</strong> focused then this frees us from endless debate about whether a particular subject is “central to the liberal arts.”</p>
<p>Its easy to view starting a new program as “planting a seed,” and as we heard over the past few weeks, when we do try a new program we must commit to making that program a success.  As teachers and mentors I think we are always planting seeds in our students.  Some of those seeds sprout quickly others need to be protected an nourished patiently over the course of three or four years.  At the end of an emotionally draining faculty meeting Dean Krause gave us a great reminder that that we can and must challenge our best students as well as our weakest students.</p>
<p>Of course we could probably have a long discussion about what it means for our students to be successful.  Some might define it in terms of outcomes, or jobs at the end of four years.  Others might define it in terms of creating a “well rounded” person.  For me,  this translates into my classes in a different way.  I have a pretty minimal syllabus with a set of goals and topics for the semester.  How fast or how slow I go, how many of the topics I cover depends on the students in the course that semester.</p>
<h2 id="resist-proxies">Resist Proxies</h2>
<p>As organizations get larger and more complex there is a tendency to manage to proxies.  Bezos mentions two proxies in his letter than resonate strongly.  Process and Surveys.  Here is what Bezos has to say about process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you’re doing the process right. Gulp. It’s not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, “Well, we followed the process.” A more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process. The process is not the thing. It’s always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bezos goes on to talk about a second dangerous proxy:  market research and surveys.  We cannot let surveys become proxies for our students, faculty, staff or alumni.  Good teachers and administrators <strong>deeply</strong> understand their students and programs. They spend tremendous energy developing that intuition. They study and understand many anecdotes rather than only the averages you’ll find on surveys.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m not against beta testing or surveys. But you, the product or service owner, must understand the customer, have a vision, and love the offering.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="embrace-external-trends">Embrace External Trends</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won’t or can’t embrace powerful trends quickly. If you fight them, you’re probably fighting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>These big trends are not that hard to spot (they get talked and written about a lot), but they can be strangely hard for large organizations to embrace.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What big trends are we fighting against right now?  Here are a few I might suggest we think about, I’m sure others can add to this list.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The trend to develop alternative revenue sources?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trend toward online learning?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A more diverse student population?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="high-velocity-decision-making">High Velocity Decision Making</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Day 2 companies make high- <strong>quality</strong> decisions, but they make high-quality decisions <strong>slowly</strong>. To keep the energy and dynamism of Day 1, you have to somehow make high-quality, <strong>high-velocity</strong> decisions. Easy for start-ups and very challenging for large organizations.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First, never use a one-size-fits-all decision-making process. Many decisions are reversible, two-way doors. Those decisions can use a light-weight process. For those, so what if you’re wrong?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Second, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow. Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Third, use the phrase “disagree and commit.” This phrase will save a lot of time. If you have conviction on a particular direction even though there’s no consensus, it’s helpful to say, “Look, I know we disagree on this but will you gamble with me on it? Disagree and commit?” By the time you’re at this point, no one can know the answer for sure, and you’ll probably get a quick yes.  This isn’t one way. If you’re the boss, you should do this too.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fourth, recognize true <strong>misalignment</strong> issues early and escalate them <strong>immediately</strong>. Sometimes teams have different objectives and fundamentally different views. They are not aligned. No amount of discussion, no number of meetings will resolve that deep misalignment. Without escalation, the default dispute resolution mechanism for this scenario is exhaustion. Whoever has more stamina carries the decision.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You’ve worn me down” is an awful decision-making process. It’s slow and de-energizing. Go for quick escalation instead – it’s better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we can learn from all of these examples.  But I especially worry about the second and fourth with respect to our work in faculty governance.</p>

			 <p>Spring Break!  Boy did I need one!   With everything going on at the college, I really needed a few days away from school to clear my head and have some fun.  What better way to do this than with friends Tim and Sandra Peter at their home in Florida!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/25c3e7c3ac.jpg" alt="Noodling with Tim "></p>
<p>Although our delta flight was full of Disney bound kids (young and old) we arrived in Orlando ahead of schedule and headed to the Peter house.  I love thier house, its perfect Florida living with a beautiful covered Lanai and a pool that Tim heated up just for our arrival.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t have a very full agenda for our time with the Peter&rsquo;s, sit by the pool, and visit Stetson were really the only two must do items on the list.  The sun and the pool were awesome.  So was the visit to Stetson.</p>
<p>We also had a great dinner out at Hillstone restaurant in Winter Park.  I had great ribs, but Tim, Sandra and Jane all had Hawaiian Rib-eye steaks.  These were so good that I had to go find the recipe for the marinade and use it the next night on pork chops!  I&rsquo;m really looking forward to trying this on steaks again on my Hasty Bake.</p>
<p>One big learning from the trip to Orlando is that we are bascially not theme park people at this stage of our lives.  We enjoyed a few of the rides but mostly we though we would have more fun just hiking somewhere.  I guess this is a fine place to be in, and if we have grand kids someday then the enjoyment will be back as we get to watch them experience things.</p>

<p>With a view like that you would think I could write something really inspirational for this final post of our journey.  Four weeks of travel with some absolutely crazy sights and adventures have wrapped themselves up here at the Likuliku Lagoon Resort in Fiji.  To put it mildly the resort is amazing.  A maximum of 96 guests, all adults, with a staff to guest ratio of about 2:1, maybe even 1:1 during the week here.  All of them greet you with a smile and the Fijian greeting of &ldquo;Bula!&rdquo;</p>
<p>You have a few options for getting to the resort from Nadi:  A ferry that makes the rounds of the islands three times a day, a private water taxi, a seaplane, or even a helicopter.  But whenever and however you arrive you will be greeted on the island by a small band playing welcome music and many Bulas.  Your luggage is whisked away and you get a cold drink and a quick orientation session on everything the resort has to offer.  Kayaks, Standup Paddleboards, and sailboats are a few of the things you can do off the beach.  Every guest in the over-water Bures is issued a mask, fins and snorkel.  There is a ladder right off the deck so you can climb down and snorkel on the reef right outside your room!  The floor in the room has two windows so that you can sit on the couch and look through the floor at the water and the fish swimming below!  Or Jane.</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon, high tide, the water is practically bath tub temperature.  The variety of fish we have seen just  outside our Bure is astounding!  We saw: Unicornfish, Clownfish, Angelfish, Parrotfish, Tang, Moorish Idol, Butterflyfish, Blue Sea Star, a Blue-spotted  Ribbontail Ray, an Eagle Ray,  a big old Moray Eel and many more.  Many of these are also visible just standing on the deck and looking in the water!  But cooling off with a bit of snorkeling is even better.  At low tide you are not supposed to snorkel in front of your Bure as the water is shallow and the reef is protected.  But you can still see some pretty amazing sights from the deck and the walkway.  Check out the video of this huge school of sardines.   Watch as the bigger fish (a Trevaly) swims though and leaves empty space behind.  The Sardines are also a favorite snack for the Gar.  Every so often as you are sitting out on the deck a school like this will go crazy and start jumping out of the water for a few seconds.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t think we have had better snorkeling anywhere in the world!  Plus the convenience of snorkeling off your own private deck just can&rsquo;t be beat.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8f28c1cca5.jpg" alt="Dinner"></p>
<p>Dinner time is really spectacular.  You are seated right along the water and at 7:00 you have a fantastic view of the sunset as you have your appetizer.  The menu is different every day and all the food is really good.  This morning I had an omelette stuffed with mud-crab meat!  For lunch we had grilled chicken with papaya salad and rice.  The chicken was so flavorful.    Our first night we had a feast of Indian and asian curries &ndash; prawns, crab, lobster, chicken, and lamb!  Last night we had delicious steak.  For lunch yesterday I had fried rice with at least a dozen big prawns with a spicy breading.  I didn&rsquo;t expect to be eating gourmet food for every meal here.</p>
<p>There are other activities you can sign up for, such as taking a wave runner for a spin to some of the nearby islands.  You can go for a two hour picnic on a deserted island, you can take a tour of the island where they filmed Castaway.  Or you can just relax, which is really the purpose of our visit.  After going and going for three and a half weeks, these last few days are the vacation from the vacation!  Today&rsquo;s activities were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get up and have coffee on the deck with my iPad while watching the fish.  I&rsquo;m trying to avoid Facebook because all of the articles and discussion about lying Donald is really depressing.  &ldquo;Alternative Facts&rdquo; for pete&rsquo;s sake stop!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walk to the restaurant for breakfast &ndash; delicious</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>come back and lounge around in the shade on the deck while reading a novel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walk to the restaurant for lunch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do some standup paddle boarding to work off the lunch</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find a shady spot by the infinity pool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get in the infinity pool to cool off</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>return to the room for high tide and snorkeling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>shower</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>open a bottle of wine for happy hour and pre-sunset drinks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walk to the restaurant for dinner</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m exhausted just listing all of these things!  😀</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/65f61c15fb.jpg" alt="Infinity"></p>
<p>Tomorrow we will spend the day here at the resort, then take the 4:00 ferry back to the main island and catch a cab to the airport.  Our Fiji airlines flight leaves tomorrow night at 9:40pm and we arrive 13 hours later,  the same day (well before we leave) in LA.  In fact we leave Fiji at 9:40pm on January 25th and we will arrive in Minneapolis at 9:00pm on January 25th.  Teleportation anyone?</p>

<p>For as little as I wanted to go to the stinky spa yesterday, Jane wanted to go to Hobbiton today even less.  She&rsquo;s not a big Lord of the Rings Fan.  But our guide told us that nearly 30% of the people who visit Hobbiton have never seen even one of movies nor have they ready any of the books.  Having seen all of the movies more than once and read the books, I was at the top of my class for our tour group of around 30 people. I think there were two of us that admitted to loving Middle Earth that much.   Do you recognize where I am standing in the picture above?  If you said Bag End, you are correct!  The home of Bilbo and Frodo.  I swear that even though I was with a very unruly tour group I could almost convince myself I was &ldquo;really&rdquo; there at times.  Oh, yes my vivid imagination.  Only slight eye roll from Jane.</p>
<p>We got there early thinking we might be able to get in on an earlier tour, but as we listened to the people who had not pre-booked their tour in front of us learn that the next available slot was 5:00 this afternoon or tomorrow we realized that we were going to have an opportunity to enjoy our crackers and cheese that we had been bringing with us for the last couple of days.  Crackers, cheese, meat and Ginger Beer, make a pretty good picnic.  I went into the gift shop to kill a little time and other than a bottle of Middle Earth wine, I was pretty much ready to leave immediately.  I was struck by the fact that they were selling &ldquo;The One Ring&rdquo; in multiple sizes!  (what!?) for only $190.00.   To be honest I knew this was coming because our tour guide, Robo, on the great ocean road told me he bought one.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/signpost.jpg" alt=""> Hobbiton is largely preserved as it was after it was rebuilt for the Hobbit trilogy.  Its amazing to me that for Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit there was less than 4 months of filming here.  Our tour guide told us several stories about how much Peter Jackson was obsessed with staying true to the book and keeping things logical.  For example we passed by some apple trees in a small grove, in the books this grove was described as plum trees.  So, Jackson made someone take all the apples and leaves off the tree and put on fake leaves and fake plums for a shot that got less than 5 seconds of screen time.  You can only imagine the outcry of true fans who would remember that they were supposed to be plum trees but saw apples on the trees in that little segment instead!</p>
<p>Another example; in the picture of me at Bag End, the tree above me is actually fake!  It was a beautiful old oak tree in the Lord of the Rings, but since the Hobbit was supposed to be 65 years earlier than LotR Jackson made the crew chop it down and replace it with a fake younger tree!  Even worse, the company in charge of making the fake leaves did a bad job on the leaves and they had faded by the time filming was supposed to start.  So, Jackson ordered someone to repaint all 200,000 leaves on the fake tree!</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/hobbit_barrow.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We also learned a bit about film tricks for making people look bigger and smaller.  Some of the hobbit holes were made quite small so that when an adult human stood beside the door they looked very large.  Others were built at full size so that the door would look fine when a hobbit was standing next to it.  In other cases parts of the set were created special to create a perspective effect.  For example the wagon that Gandalf and Frodo are riding in the wagon together the wagon was constructed to be 3 meters long.  Gandalf rode in the front so that he looked very big while Frodo sat in the very back so that when filmed he looked very small, and like he was sitting next to Gandalf.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/green_dragon.jpg" alt="Green Dragon"></p>
<p>At the end of the tour we stopped at the Green Dragon for Ale!  I don&rsquo;t think this was where the scenes were filmed as every other structure here was created for filming from the outside in, or with just enough room for the camera crew to film from the inside out.  All indoor scenes were filmed in the studio, but this is part of the process of making Hobbiton more interesting for visitors.  We had a couple of choices of Ale, a cider, or a Ginger Beer.  This was also a great place to get some pictures of the Green Dragon along with the Mill and the pond.</p>
<p>The tour really makes you appreciate camera angles!  On the bus back to the gift shop we saw some video clips from the movie and its amazing how large everything looks compared to how it seems in person.  I can&rsquo;t wait to get home and watch the extended edition disks that Josh bought me for Christmas.  Maybe with a few days off we will find time to watch them together.</p>
<p>Today was also our last day in New Zealand and marks the beginning of the journey home.  Tomorrow morning we fly to Fiji!  The Novotel airport is just 25 yards from the entrance to the international terminal, so one good thing is that we don&rsquo;t even need a cab to get to the airport in plenty of time for our flight!   I&rsquo;m looking forward to a couple days of R&amp;R on the water!</p>

<p>I woke up several times during the night, and each time I did I could hear the rain battering the metal roof of our condo.  Around 5:30 Jane woke up enough to say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to go mountain biking on muddy trails.&rdquo; Then she rolled over and went back to sleep.  I figured she was probably right, even if the sun did come out this morning riding 20 miles on mud would not be a good first go at Mountain Biking.  Especially knowing that at the end of the ride we had to get in the car and drive to Rotorua.  After 3 plus weeks on the road we have lost our will to stop at any more charming roadside waterfalls, so todays trip was just a drive through the countryside.</p>
<p>So, we lazed around the condo and made a leisurely drive up the east side of Lake Taupo.  We walked around the shopping area and had an early lunch at the Master of India restaurant in Taupo.  It was quite good, I had the Vindaloo and Jane had Korma, we split an order of Naan and Basmati and some Ginger Beer.  I&rsquo;m going to have to talk to someone at Fareway about stocking Ginger Beer! After lunch we made our way North for another hour to Rotorua.  We had nothing special planned here as this was mostly meant as a stopover night (in close proximity to Hobbiton) on the way to Auckland.  However the Novotel here by the lake is quite nice, it is right next to Eat Street and we have a view of the lake.</p>
<p>Jane has been wanting to stop at a volcanic hot spring spa for a few days now, and I have been resisting.  But the brochure for the Polynesian Spa looked pretty nice and they had either a private option or an adult only group of pools.  So, I gave in.  I&rsquo;m 75% done with Jack Reacher #13 so I could easily have stayed in the room and finished that book.  But that seemed silly.  We decided to go for the adult option because that gave us a choice of 8 different pools and there was no time limit.  We would have to wait for the private pool and then we were limited to 30 minutes.  Anyway, communal bathing is certainly illustrative of many interesting cultural differences.  The pools are constantly fed by natural hot spring water from right under the pools.  There are two types of hot springs here:  One that is good for your joints, and one that tarnishes the gold of your class ring. &ndash; Yes there are warning signs, and <strong>I</strong> took note and left my ring in my backpack.  Jane now has a black 6 in her Luther ring.  Hopefully it can be restored.</p>
<p>My only addition would be to say that the Sulfur and other assorted gasses were rather pungent.  You may have guessed that already.   As a reward for being-a-good-guy-and-going-to-the-spa-with-my-wife, the hotel left a complimentary bottle of  Volcanic Hills Chardonnay by our bed.  Its now two minutes past happy hour so I will post this, and see what we think.  Its from the Hawkes Bay region and so far those have all been good.  New Zealand is really good with their Chardonnays and their Pinot Noirs.  No wonder I like this country.</p>
<p>Later we have a booking for dinner at a nice Italian place right on Eat Street called Leonardo&rsquo;s Pure Italian.</p>

			 <p>The goal for today had been to bike the Timber Trail.  But since the forecast was for lots of rain we arranged to postpone that until Friday.  My next hope was that we would be able to see Mount Doom <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.   But we didn&rsquo;t get to see that version (thankfully!), I&rsquo;ll just have to watch the Lord of the Rings again to see that one.    We also didn&rsquo;t get to see this version <!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  It seems that the weather on the North island has been a bit unsettled.  Instead we saw this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->. Mount Doom (Mt. Ngauruhoe) might be back there somewhere behind all the clouds.</p>
<p>Instead of hiking the Tongariro Alpine trail for seven hours we took the &ldquo;easy way out&rdquo; an hiked the 2 hour trail to Taranaki Falls.  When we started out it was mostly just cloudy and misty.  But just after the falls it got bad, really bad.  The rain was coming sideways and even my mantra about good gear was not enough to overcome the chilling discomfort seeping through my pants and filling my shoes.  The falls were nice but we have seen lots of falls like these in New Zealand.</p>

<p>More than anything this walk was to get us out of the hotel and doing something for a portion of our day.   We can&rsquo;t just hang out in our room all day.  Although we have a really nice 2-bedroom apartment that we could enjoy.  We had hoped that the forecast was wrong that that once we got to the visitor center there would be plenty of trails to hike and enjoy.</p>
<p>Thankfully, we have a washer and a dryer, so after today we will have enough clean clothes to make it all the way back home without washing again!  Our shoes are going to require a bit of work to get dry.  We learned a good trick on the Routeburn:  stuff your shoes with newspaper to help them dry overnight.  Our room is pretty short on newspaper though so we&rsquo;ll see what happens.  The dryer is pretty hot so I&rsquo;m not very enthusiastic about putting them in the dryer and letting them tumble around.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/soaked.jpg" alt="Soaked"></p>
<p>As I write this, I think we might have gotten our day backwards!  I&rsquo;m looking out the window and at 2:00 in the afternoon the rain has stopped and we are seeing some blue sky.  This is not out of line with the forecast this morning which showed a higher chance of blue sky <strong>and</strong> rain for this afternoon!  There is a winery a few miles away&hellip;  Pinot Noir Rose and wood fired pizzas!</p>

			 <p><img src="../images/NZ/kayaking.jpg" alt="Kayaking"></p>
<p>When Jane told me that if the weather was right we might be able to sail our kayaks I was perplexed.  &ldquo;How do you add a mast to a Kayak?&rdquo;  I thought to myself.  So I had mostly put it out of my mind as an option until we were an hour into the first of two two-hour paddles today.  But then &ldquo;Captain Jack&rdquo; told us to make a raft and he started talking about how we would sail the kayaks.  The sail consisted of a big black square of fabric with big loops at each corner. We had four Kayaks so the women (Jane and Dani) sitting in the front of the two outside kayaks were instructed to put the loops around their wrists and hold on.  The</p>
<p>men in the two outside back Kayaks (Brad and Michael) were instructed to put the loops around one end of their paddles.  When we put the paddles in our laps and hoisted the sail we were off!  Sadly Kayaking and photography do not go together very well so this is the best picture we have of our sailing adventure.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/sailing.jpg" alt="Sailing!"></p>
<p>Kayaking made us both feel pretty old.  about 5 minutes into the second 2 hour leg my arms started to cramp up.  I&rsquo;ve been having a little tennis elbow in my left arm lately and that really started to hurt for a bit, luckily after the initial flare up it worked its way out and I was able to paddle.   After 30 minutes both of Jane&rsquo;s hands started to cramp, fingers pointing in all kinds of unnatural directions that needed to be moved back in place manually.  She wasn&rsquo;t able to paddle for more than a few seconds at a time from then on except for a few key places where we really needed both of us to paddle hard.  Incoming waves, outgoing tide, and a river flowing out make for some FUN kayaking conditions along the coast.  I really wish we could have captured them on camera,  but those moments will have to live on in our memories only!</p>
<p>By the time we finished our afternoon of Kayaking we were both done!  Our final day gave us the option of hiking or kayaking and it didn&rsquo;t take any deliberation for us to realize that we had reached our limit.  six more hours of Kayaking was definitely not in our future.  Looking back, we made the right decision, and we enjoyed our final day of hiking very much.</p>

<p>Estuary:  the tidal mouth of a river where the river meets the tide.</p>
<p>The final leg of our hike today ended with an estuary crossing.  We arrived about an hour before low tide so our guide, Jack, suggested that we just chill a bit and wait for the tide to go down before we started our crossing.  So we walked around and counted the tiny little crabs and found some shrimp in a little stream.  then we watched some of the other hikers standing in water up to their knees waiting doubtfully for the tide to ebb.  At last Jack announced we would head out at 5:00, don&rsquo;t worry he said it won&rsquo;t be any higher than mid-thigh.  OK, Jack was a bit shorter than me so I wasn&rsquo;t worried.</p>
<p>The wider darker blue areas will be shallower he said, so aim for those if you are in doubt.   At 5 to 5 Jane and I started walking.  When we got to our knees we encountered the other hikers, still standing and waiting.  I pressed and found a path that came just above my knees.  &ldquo;This way,&rdquo; I said and just like that I&rsquo;m a leader.  A bit further on the water got deeper and Jane was nearly to her waist.  I was definitely above mid thigh, and feeling the current of the tide heading out.</p>
<p>That was as deep as it got and so we made it to the other side of the estuary feeling like this was our adventure for the day.  It was a beautiful 7km walk and totally different than the Routeburn.  With the ocean on one side of you at all times and regular boat service to lots of beaches all day long you feel much closer to the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; than you do on the Routeburn.  The scenery is also quite different with views of the bay rather than inland lakes.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/golden_bay.jpg" alt="golden bay"></p>
<p>Like our Routeburn adventure, the day ended at a lodge that has been part of the Wilson family&rsquo;s land since the 1800&rsquo;s, well before this land became a national park.  We had a delicious meal of lamb and mash and salad, and had a good time getting to know the other 8 hikers on our 3 day trip.  We had already met Teresa and Jerad from Melbourne on the bus.   There was also a couple from Northern Ireland (Michael and Dani) on their honeymoon and a family from Adelaide (Ronnie, Jeff, Craig and Lisa).  All were very nice, and once again we had several educators plus some Geologists in the group.  Once again it was a very fine group to share an adventure with and we hope our paths may cross again some day.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://reputablejournal.com/2017/01/13/100000.html">Driving the West Coast</a></h1>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>After two weeks of organized tours and bus rides we struck out on our own today in a rental car.  New Zealand drives on the left and there are many helpful arrows painted on the road to remind the foreign drivers of that fact.  As always, Jane took the drivers seat and I rode shotgun in on the passenger side.  We left Queenstown after a nice breakfast at the hotel and headed toward the west coast.  Our destination for the first night was Franz Josef.  A small little town near the Franz Josef glacier.</p>
<p>A couple of observations about driving in New Zealand</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One lane bridges are everywhere!  We counted twenty seven one lane bridges on our 280km journey the first day.  I think this is part of the great environmental movement in New Zealand that they think really carefully before messing with anything in nature.  Sure it slows you down a bit and occasionally you need to wait for a couple of cars to cross before you can take your turn but maybe a reminder to slow down is a good thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They have these nice bullseye signs that say 100 its not a target, drive according to conditions.  its pretty hard to drive 100km/hr anyway as the roads are very twisty.  I would guess we averaged closer to 60km/hr.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cell phone coverage outside the cities is pretty much non-existent.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure this is again related to the environmental focus of the country.  Don&rsquo;t mess up the countryside by installing thousands of cell towers.  This also impacts things like Google maps where the travel time estimates are wildly wrong.  If they don&rsquo;t get any feedback on the actual speed people drive the only thing they can rely on is the posted speed limits, which are way higher than almost anyone drives!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We stopped in the grocery store on the way out of Queenstown to pick up some meat and cheese, bread, and Ginger Beer,   so we could do a simple lunch somewhere along the way.   Once we reached the west coast, we drove in rain most of the day, and nothing we could see in a two minute walk from the side of the road could compare to what we saw on the Routeburn Track. Our lodging that night was at a small boutique B&amp;B (The Westwood Lodge).  It was super nice, just like the host who gave us a nice recommendation to go to Alice May for dinner.  We did and we had a nice meal: Fish and Chips for Jane and I had a stuffed chicken breast with Brie cheese.</p>
<p>The next morning dawned sunny and clear, so we felt really great about our decision to postpone our visit to the glacier until the morning.  On the way to the glacier it started to sprinkle a bit again, but by the time we had hiked closer to the glacier we were rewarded with nice sunny weather again!  We were also lucky that we didn&rsquo;t try to go the day before because one of the wooden bridges across one of the many creeks had been washed out in a downpour the previous day.  <img src="../images/NZ/washout.jpg" alt="Bridge Out"> we picked our way across the stone in the now-very-tame creek and continued to the glacier.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/franz_josef.jpg" alt="Franz Josef"></p>
<p>On the way back we noticed a couple of construction workers with their massive power tools standing around watching each other prepare to work.  We assumed that they were going to excavate and rebuild the bridge.  A project likely to take weeks at their pace.  Yes, construction seems to move at the same speed everywhere in the world.  But as we walked further we met up with a dozen cheerful  red-shirted volunteers carrying shovels and pickaxes.  They were headed to fix the bridge too.  I recon they took care of it by lunch time.</p>
<p>After our glacier hike we continued our way north.  We didn&rsquo;t have far to go and todays destination was a small B&amp;B called Breakers, just north of Greymouth. We were met by the owner, Jan, who was a very delightful person to chat with.  She was amazed at how light we were traveling and suggested we may want to give lessons to some of her previous guests.  We arrived in mid-afternoon, with nothing else on the agenda except for lounging around and enjoying the view of the Tasman sea.  Huge wave after wave coming in from the west was mesmerizing.  We didn&rsquo;t even leave the B&amp;B for dinner that night as Jan made us a nice homemade pizza to enjoy in the comfort of our room or on the nice back porch.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/tasman.jpg" alt="Tasman View"></p>
<p>Our final day of driving was the longest, but we made some fun stops along the way to break up the driving.  The first was at Pancake Rock.  Once again great views of the Tasman Sea, Blowholes in the rocks and just really interesting rock formations to gawk at.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/pancake_rock.jpg" alt="Pancake Rock"></p>
<p>The second stop was a tourist trap, but we stopped willingly to wander across the southern hemisphere&rsquo;s longest swinging bridge.  Spanning the Buller Gorge it was a nice view, but not nearly so much fun to have to pass someone on the bridge.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/buller_bridge.jpg" alt="Swinging Bridge"></p>
<p>Once we got closer to Nelson and realized we had plenty of time to spare before the rental car drop-off closed we decided to head into wine country and visit a couple of wineries in the hills Northwest of Nelson.  We made a stop at Kaharunga and Neudorf wineries.  This region is known for some pretty nice Chardonnays and rightly so.  We need to figure out how to get some Neudorf delivered to the US.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>As we walked back from Ultimate Hikes to the Lovely St. Moritz hotel we stopped at the Real Journeys office to check on our reservation for Milford Sound.  We had sort of concluded that if the helicopter return was not going to go, and we could back out at this late time, we would cancel and just enjoy a day of leisure in Queenstown.  The Helicopter was not confirmed, we were the only two booked, and they need at least four people booked to fly.  But we couldn&rsquo;t cancel either. &ndash; Real Journeys take note, this is a terrible and unfair policy!  To charge someone full fare to cancel a flight that is not even confirmed is ridiculous.  With the NSF grant deadline about 36 hours away I was ready to cancel anyway and stay in the room to finish up my work on the grant.</p>
<p>The morning came and it was sunny and nice in Queenstown, so I did a bit of grant work and decided I would take my iPad on the bus.  After all, I had already seen the first four hours of the trip on our journey to the Routeburn Track!  The first bit of luck for the day was that the bus had WiFi!  At least until just after Te Anau.  So, I had about three hours of time to work on the grant and upload things to the NSF website.  By the time we got to Te Anau I was feeling really good and I had all of the stuff for Luther uploaded.</p>
<p>The next bit of good news was that our driver seemed pretty confident that even though the clouds were really low and the fixed wing planes were on hold, the helicopters would still fly.  But we still would not know whether we had another four hour bus ride at the end of the boat tour of the sound or whether we would have a nice 45 minute helicopter tour back to Queenstown at the end of the boat ride.  We would just have to wait to know for sure.  But again, Barry the bus driver was optimistic.</p>
<p>The two hour boat tour of Milford Sound was really great.  The boat moved along slowly just a few meters from the sheer mountainside.  The walls of the mountain come straight out of the water and soar 5-6 thousand meters over us.  You really can&rsquo;t grasp the scale of it unless you see another boat or some people to give you an idea.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/milford_scale.jpg" alt="Milford Scale"></p>
<p>When we made it to the Tasman sea at the end of the sound and looked back we marveled that anyone would ever think to try to bring a ship there!  You can&rsquo;t tell from the oceanside that there is this narrow sound leading back to a nice little spot to land and build a small town.  Nevertheless Captain Thomas Cook did follow the sound back and mapped out the area.</p>
<p>The highlight of the boat trip was definitely the final waterfall.  The captain took our boat right up to the base of the fall, and we looked straight up at water falling some 52 stories!  The height of the IDS tower in Minneapolis, nothing but water falling straight down at you.  It is really beautiful.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/milford_scale1.jpg" alt="Milford Scale"></p>
<p>When we arrived back at Milford the captain announced that we had made it just in time as the weather was about to &ldquo;turn to custard.&rdquo; Whatever that meant we were not sure but we were pretty sure that helicopters are not meant to fly in custard.  So we walked back to bus 17 steeling ourselves for another four hours on the coach.  Fortunately when we arrived at the bus we were met with a big thumbs up from Barry!  At least one other couple had upgraded to confirm our helicopter tour back to Queenstown!  Now we just had to get out of Milford before the custard formed.</p>
<p>We rode the shuttle to the airport with another couple from our bus and hopped off just in time to see one helicopter take off and another, the color we were looking for, come in for a landing.  However&hellip; as the pilot got out of our copter and started toward us, a bus pulled up and dropped off another couple.  the pilot looked at all of our tickets and got a very perplexed look on his face.  the two people he had brought in were booked to go right back, and now there were a total of eight of us for a six passenger ride.  After some time, and a lot of anxious looking at the clouds turning to custard it was finally determined that the previous pilot had left prematurely.  He would turn around and come back for the final couple to arrive.  The rest of us would be on our way.  After a very short safety briefing we boarded and took off.</p>
<p>Jane was on one side of the helicopter and I was on the other.  She was on the side closest to the mountain.  As I kept looking at her side I kept thinking how glad I was on my side.  Her side seemed to be just feet from the side of the sheer mountain!  One gust of wind and we are goners I thought.  But, no worries, these Kiwi Alpine pilots know their stuff.  The ride turned out to be (mostly) smooth and really really beautiful.  what a treat to fly over some of the mountains we had hiked through in the beautiful sunlight.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/alpine_lake.jpg" alt="Alpine Lake"></p>
<p>Our adventures were not over because the flight home included a short stop on a glacier!  Well, more of a big snowbank than a glacier, and really I didn&rsquo;t think there was any way we could land in the spot we landed.  It didn&rsquo;t look level and the pilot landed just feet from the edge.  Did I mention these Alpine pilots are really really good?  so we got out and tramped about in the snow for a few minutes, Jane in nothing but sandals!  Pictures were taken and we were all in awe of the beauty.  But very soon we piled back in the helicopter and took off for the last bit of our journey to Queenstown.  We were back by 5:10, a full three hours before the coach was supposed to be back, plus we had an amazing helicopter adventure!</p>

			 <h2 id="day-zero">Day Zero</h2>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/green_falls.jpg" alt="New Zealand Falls"></p>
<p>We arrived in Queenstown just in time to appreciate the change in temperature. We left the 90 degree weather in Melbourne and arrived to 70 degree weather in Queenstown.  It was a very welcome change in both temperature and scenery.  It takes about 30 seconds to realize why Peter Jackson decided to film Lord of the Rings here!  The steep Mountains and misty low clouds around Lake Wakatipu  make you want to break out into some  dwarf songs.</p>
<p>We had just enough time to check into the St. Moritz before a short walk down the hill to the Ultimate Hikes center for our pre-hike briefing.  Now is a good time to note that Jane and I have. noticed that we are no longer the young couple on the tours we have chosen.  Most of the people we have met and toured with so far on this trip have been 20 years younger than us.  Life Happens!  As we contemplated 3 days of hiking with 30 year olds we were getting a bit nervous.  So, we were pretty relieved to see that the vast majority of the 27 people at our briefing were in our age bracket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no bad weather, only bad gear!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t take anything else away from the briefing it was this quote.  And we were really glad that we had done our homework and invested in some good rain gear and merino wool.</p>
<h2 id="day-one">Day One</h2>
<p>The first day of the trek kicked by meeting our guides &ndash; Jono, Anthony, Sadao, and Jo &ndash; then a bus ride leaving Queenstown at 6:30AM.  We had a two hour bus ride until our stop morning tea in Te Anau.  Every tour in Australia and New Zealand includes a stop for morning tea and scones.  Very civilized.  We had a couple more hours on the bus after morning tea before we got to the start of the trek in the Fiordland National Park.  This first day we had around four hours of trekking (7.5 miles) to get to our first night&rsquo;s lodging at Lake Mackenzie. The first hour and a half was all up hill pretty steadily, so even though we were geared up for the 50 degree weather and rain we began shedding layers only a few minutes into the hike.  With four guides, one was at the front, one at the back and two floated between people in the middle.  It didn&rsquo;t take long for us to stretch out with the back being about an hour behind the front.  We were somewhere near the middle.</p>
<p>We carried our lunches in with us, and we carried the rubbish out.  The National Parks in New Zealand have no rubbish bins to prevent animals from learning to scavenge food.  It works well.  I don&rsquo;t think we saw one bit of litter anywhere along the track.  We hiked uphill to Howden Hut where we had our lunch stop along with hot tea and coffee made by our guides.  We walked out of the rain shortly after lunch and enjoyed a really scenic hike through the afternoon.  The highlight of the afternoon was definitely the Earland Falls.  Anthony said, make sure you have your inhalers, it will take your breath away.  And he was right.  As with many of the sites on our trip pictures don&rsquo;t do justice to the actual scene.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/earland_falls.jpg" alt="Earland Falls"></p>
<p>We arrived MacKenzie hut around 4:00 and we were definitely ready to stop for the day.  We were met at the entrance by Chris who had hot chocolate (called Milo here down under) and snacks for us.  He gave us a quick tour of the lodge and showed us to our room.   We were  blown away by the accomodations.  Ultimate Hikes made some kind deal with the Department of Conservation (DOC) whereby they built new facilities for the park in exchange for getting the concession for guided hikes and the ability to build their own huts on the track.  They were so clean and nice.  We had our own room with ensuite and shower.  There was a clothes washing area, and a huge warm room called the drying room.  Then a really nice common area where we could hang out, have a drink, eat our meals and get to know the rest of our group.</p>
<p>For dinner tonight we had entrees of Hummus or Salmon spread with cheese and meat.  For our main we had  our choice between a New Zealand Rib Eye and Chicken.  For desert we had brownies and ice cream.   Yes we were &ldquo;roughing it&rdquo; all right.  It took us a few meals to understand that in Australia and New Zealand they call appetizers &ldquo;entrees&rdquo; and the entree is called the &ldquo;main.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/mackenzie_lodge.jpg" alt="mackenzie_lodge"></p>
<p>Unfortunately the first night we also got to watch a helicopter landing.  One of our group had fallen on the track and broken her wrist and hurt her leg pretty badly. So, she and her husband were evacuated by helicopter.  The rescue team landed on a tiny little pad right next to the hut.  Clearly these guys know what they are doing to drop out of the clouds and land right on target.</p>
<p>At 10:00 the generators are shut off until 7:30 the next morning.  But that really wasn&rsquo;t a problem as we were all in bed by 9:30 that first night!  I was talking to one of the guides about their arrangement with the DOC and he said that the generator times, along with every detail down to the dishwashing soap and toilet paper was negotiated to have minimal environmental impact on the National Park.   Everything at the hut is flown in and out by helicopter once a week.</p>
<h2 id="day-two">Day Two</h2>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/lake_mackenzie.jpg" alt="Mackenzie Lake"></p>
<p>Day two began with sandwich making at 7:45.  Amazingly we slept solid until 7:00 when I needed to get up and use the ensuite.   A few experimental steps revealed that all the limbs were still working as they should with amazingly little stiffness.  Continental breakfast was at 8:15 followed by eggs Benedict at 8:30.  At 9:15 we met for a group photo by Lake Mackenzie and then we were off for a good six hours of walking.   The beginning was again steadily up hill, then we rounded the mountain onto the rainy and windy side! The distance for today was just 6.9 miles but it was slower going than yesterday! There is no bad weather, only bad gear I repeated to myself.  Nevertheless we made it to the hut on Harris Saddle for our rest/lunch stop.  After lunch I did the optional climb up Conical Hill while Jane continued on towards the Routeburn Lodge with a few others.  After the Harris Saddle and the Conical Hill the rest of the day was down hill  which was nice but pretty hard on my calfs.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/harris_lake.jpg" alt="Conical Hill"></p>
<p>A couple times today we were rewarded with a glimpse of what a great view we could have on one of the rare clear days.  Still it was all beautiful in a Lord of the Rings kind of way.  Although I walked by myself most of the afternoon, I enjoyed just going my own pace and enjoying the views.</p>
<p>The second night we stayed at Routeburn lodge.  By the way if you&rsquo;ve been reading Routeburn as &ldquo;rowt burn&rdquo; you are doing it wrong, it is &ldquo;root burn.&rdquo; This lodge is very similar to the Lake Mackenzie lodge but with a great view of the valley and the Routeburn falls right behind.  We were all bit more tired and a lot more wet than we were the day before.  So dinner was served a bit earlier.  Tonights fare included a delicious Pesto soup as the entree followed by a choice of Salmon or New Zealand lamb chops.  By now we had gotten to know a lot of our fellow trekkers pretty well, so before dinner and during dinner conversation was very lively.  We have met a surprising number of people from Chicago on this trip and we have really enjoyed getting to know them, especially Dave and Lynn Reiner.  We also met lots of nice people from New Zealand including a couple women (Jennifer and Megan) who reminded me of Jane and Shirley if they had New Zealand accents and were to take off on their own adventure.  Lots of the people in the group were involved in education including the two women I mentioned and  Professor Tiano from Duke University in Singapore.</p>
<p>It was nice to be surrounded by other academics as I was beginning to stress about the impending NSF grant deadline back home.  Leaving my co-authors to finish the proposal while I was totally off the grid for 3 days is not the best plan. Of course agreeing to do the grant in the first place when you know the deadline is in the middle of your holiday does not show the best judgement either.</p>
<h2 id="day-three">Day Three</h2>
<p>I woke up at about 4AM on day three, once again needing to use the ensuite.  However my first couple of steps out of bed were so painful I spent the next couple hours in and out of sleep wondering if my muscles would loosen enough for me to walk down the track on my own power.  Thankfully day three dawned bright and sunny for the final 5.7 miles of our trek.  Once again we started our day with sandwich making followed by continental breakfast and then eggs and bacon.  Sadly it took me until day three to get lesson in making a proper cup of Milo from Jono.  To anyone who may happen upon this in preparation for a trip to New Zealand here is the procedure:  pour a couple tablespoons of cream into your coffee cup, then add six, yes six, spoonfuls of milo and mix it into a paste with the cream.  You may have to add more to get the right pasty consistency.  Then after you have a good chocolatey paste you can add the hot water.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/routeburn_flats.jpg" alt="Routeburn Flats"></p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s walk was the easiest of the three with the route being mostly down hill to the Routeburn flats and then more gentle downhill  for the 5.7 mile distance to the end of the route.  We had several intermediate stops along the way including an early lunch along the river.  By the end of the trek we felt like we had really experienced New Zealand at its best.  Great people, great scenery, no crowds, just lots of great natural beauty.</p>
<p><img src="../images/NZ/final_lunch.jpg" alt="River"></p>
<p>Our final stop of the trek was at the pub in Glenorchy for a schooner of ale and the presentation of our certificates of achievement!  Several suggested that this certificate of achievement would make a good addition to my bio for the grant proposal 😜</p>

<h3 id="arrival-and-trolly-tour">Arrival and Trolly Tour</h3>
<p>We arrived in Melbourne and took a little dinner tour of the city on a dinner trolly.  We thought it would be mediocre food, but a good way to see the city.  It turned out that the food was better than expected, and in the end we didn&rsquo;t see too much of Melbourne.  Still fun, and we got to see &ldquo;The Original Taco Bills&rdquo;. Those of you who were at Luther in the 80&rsquo;s will appreciate the Taco Bills excitement.</p>

<h3 id="the-great-ocean-road">The Great Ocean Road</h3>
<p>The great ocean road was built along the southern coast of Australia in the 30&rsquo;s by men in the ANZAC (Australia New Zealand Army Corps). These were primarily WWI soldiers who needed work, and time to recover from the war.  The statue at the beginning of the road commemorates these men.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Australia/parrots.jpg" alt="parrots"></p>
<p>Aside from our morning tea, and a lunch stop we made three main stops today:  One for a Koala and Parrot viewing, the second for a 30 minute hike in the rain forest and the third at the 12 Apostles.  Although the crowds were as thick as the flies the 12 Apostles were really the highlight of the day.  Fun fact:  The Australian government originally called these &ldquo;the apostles&rdquo; since there were only nine of them, but the tourists kept referring to them as the 12 apostles so eventually some marketing person in the government gave in and they renamed the site to the 12 Apostles and it remains that to this day.  The name is increasingly less accurate at the moment as one of the  9 came down a few years back.   However, in a few thousand years it is likely that the numbers will increase again as erosion along the shore does its work.</p>

<p>WOW!  we haveve just finished a day on a live aboard dive boat where we did 4 dives and 2 snorkels on the great barrier reef.  I saw Nemo, Dory and all the rest, except for Crush!  Plus we saw sea slugs, octopus, sharks (not Bruce!!) lobster, and many many more.  My ear is a bit plugged up from the four dives, but its worth a few days of having the world sound a little muffled.  I haven&rsquo;t even mentioned that one of the dives was a night dive!  We stood on the ship and looked at the reef sharks swimming next to the ship and still jumped in with our &ldquo;torches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Night diving is definitely a bit eerie and I&rsquo;ll admit I was a bit nervous about that one.  It was quite the sensation to be underwater-weightless and in complete darkness except for the light from your own flashlight. We saw a lot of fish that we did not see during the day and of course we saw a bunch of sharks.  Not the man-eating kind, just the normal kind that are more afraid of us than we are of them.  The most common fish we saw on the night dive was the Giant Trevally.   They were not afraid of our lights, and in fact  knew just how to take advantage of them.  If you held your light on a smaller fish for too long one of these big Trevallys would swoop in and &hellip; there would no longer be a smaller fish there.  Unfortunately we did not get any pictures during the night dive, but the next morning we did a 6:30AM dive and were rewarded with a glassy sea and crystal clear water for viewing lots of active fish.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Australia/angel.jpg" alt="Angel"></p>
<p>The boat we were on was called Reef Encounter and was by far the best diving experience ever!  The crew was really knowledgeable and really helpful with novice and rusty divers alike.  Our guide for the whole trip was Hugo and and he was fantastic.  He was very patient with reminding us of all the details of setting up our gear, and let me descend as slowly as I needed to in order to keep my ears from exploding.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Australia/reef_fish1.jpg" alt="Reef"></p>
<p>The live aboard boat is really the way to do the great barrier reef as you don&rsquo;t spend three hours of your day getting out and back from the reef.  Rather you can spend most of the first day diving, and again the second day you can start first thing in the morning.  We transferred to the boat from shore on a day excursion boat that tied up with our ship to let us off and then pick us up again the next day.   We had great company while onboard and because we were a part of the &ldquo;Top Deck&rdquo; program we ate our meals on the top deck with just a few other people that we enjoyed getting to know.  In addition since things are very informal and everyone is on there to snorkel or dive we only brought our day packs with swimming suits, toiletries and an extra t-shirt.  They don&rsquo;t allow any shoes on board so there was no worrying about extra shoes to wear to dinner either.</p>
<p>When we returned to Cairns it was pouring rain and our guy Hugo offered to escort us off the boat with his umbrella.  Sadly it was not an umbrella built for 3 and the wind was blowing so hard that the rain was mostly horizontal anyway, so even the nicest umbrella in the world would not have helped too much.  The reception at the Shangri La was super nice when we arrived and immediately gave us towels to dry off with while they checked us in and retrieved the luggage we had stored there while we were on the live aboard.</p>

			 <p><img src="../images/Australia/uluru.jpg" alt="Uluru"></p>
<p>Today we flew three hours and 1.5 timezones out of our way to see a big red rock!  I&rsquo;m not sure where to start unpacking this, the 1.5 timezones or the big red rock.  But if you do a bit of research on Australia and the aboriginal people you will quickly learn about Uluru, or Ayer&rsquo;s Rock.   If you are on the right side of the plane you will get a nice view of this huge rock rising up in the middle of hundreds of miles of flatness.  The picture above was taken at our outdoor dinner experience called &ldquo;The Sounds of Silence.&rdquo;  There were about 60 of us out on a sand dune in the desert with a great view of Uluru and its sister called Kata-Tjuta.  We were seated at a table with a family from Melbourne and a family from the US.  The one son that I sat next to worked at Google as a software engineer, needless to say we had some good conversation that night.</p>
<p>Our plan had been to rent some bikes and ride around Uluru, but unfortunately last week they had massive rainstorms that washed out many of the trails, so they were closed except for one very short walking trail.  We visited the head of that trail on the afternoon we arrived but didn&rsquo;t go very far as the temperatures were over 100 degrees, and no shade in sight!  We changed our plan to drive a short distance and hike the Valley of the Winds at Kata-Tjuta.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Australia/kata_tjuta1.jpg" alt="First View Point"></p>
<p>We got up and out the door by 6AM to make sure that we could hike in the coolest part of the day.  They actually will close the hiking trails around 11AM if the temp is forecast to be over 37 Celsius! The hike to this first view point was easy and and a good way to warm up our hiking trail legs.  However when we arrived at the first viewpoint the sign told us that the rest of the trail was closed!  We, and the four other people  that were a few minutes behind us assumed that this was simply a left over from yesterday and they hadn&rsquo;t changed the sign yet that morning.  So, we ignored the sign and pressed on for the Karingana lookout.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Australia/kata_tjuta1.jpg" alt="First View Point"></p>
<p>What a reward for an excellent little hike!</p>
<p>Although Ayer&rsquo;s Rock is definitely a bit out of the way it was definitely worth the time and effort to see it.  It is considered a sacred place to the Anangu people.  Maybe it was the remoteness of the place or the lack of crowds, but you could definitely get a sense that it was a special place.</p>

			 <p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>Celebrating the new year in Australia is definitely something special.  Everywhere we went the air in the city smelled like barbecue, and people were queueing to get into the free parks all afternoon.  There is definitely a lot of pride by the people of Sydney in their preparations for the big show.  We spent a good part of the morning hiking around Bondi beach and the surrounding area.  Then we just chilled at the flat for most of the afternoon, watching the families queuing to get the best position to view the fireworks.</p>
<p>When they opened the gates to the park right below our flat at 6:00 it had the feel of a giant family picnic!</p>

<p>One great way to get over jet lag is to just get up in the morning and get going again.  Although we only made it until 8:30 last night we did manage to sleep until about 4 AM.  Our Blue Mountain tour started at 6:30 AM so we were wide awake and ready to go with no trouble.  We had a great guide for a day long tour out into the Blue Mountains outside of Sydney.  After a 90 minute drive from Sydney we stopped for Tea and Scones before our visit to Echo point to see the three sisters Meehni, Wimlah and Gunnedoo.  Legend has it that their father turned them to stone rather than let them marry three brothers from a rival tribe.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Australia/three_sisters.jpg" alt="Three Sisters"></p>
<p>Aboriginal legends in Australia are just as believable as the native american legends in the USA.  However if you look closely at the picture you&rsquo;ll notice there are actually four pillars of stone, the smallest one is their little brother Dave.  Made famous a few years back when the locals started a social media campaign to #RememberDave.</p>
<p>There are a lot of great hiking trails in the area, including one which will bring you right over to the three sisters.  We were on an easier tour instead of a several mile hike we got in line at Scenic World and rode the gondola across.  This gave us a great, if fleeting, view of some waterfalls.  From there we took another gondola on a steep descent into the rain forest.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Australia/scenic_world.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Once you are in the rainforest they have three options:  a 10, 20 or 30 minute walk through the forest on a nice safe boardwalk.  At the end you can ride up the train (the steepest in the world) to the top.  All in all it was very scenic and a nice walk but I think we would have preferred to skip the lines for the &lsquo;rides&rsquo; and just walk the trails on our own.</p>
<p>After a very nice lunch of fish and chips we made our way to  Featherdale to have our picture taken with a Koala and to feed the Kangaroos.  Before we arrived I was calling it the &lsquo;petting zoo&rsquo;, but in the end it turned out alright. Coming face to face with a real Kangaroo is definitely cool.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Australia/koala.jpg" alt="Koala"></p>
<p>In addition Featherdale had lots of really interesting native animals including a Tasmanian Devil &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t look anything at all like the one from the bugs bunny cartoons.  But its jaw muscles are among the strongest in the animal kingdom.  We also saw a Cassowary - think a turkey crossed with a Velociraptor.  In fact they say it is a holdover from the dinosaurs.  They have a hard crown (called a casque) on top of their head which is probably used as a sound box or radar for picking up the low frequency calls these creatures make.   The Cassowary an endangered species but almost nobody has heard about them because they are not nearly as cute as the Koalas.  They can jump six feet in the air and sprint 30 mph! I would not want to be chased by one.</p>
<p>To round out the day we had a quick tour through Sydney&rsquo;s Olympic park.  Still a very vibrant area to this day.  And then a water taxi ride back to the Circle Quay in the heart of Sydney.</p>
<h4 id="note-1">Note 1</h4>
<p>The picture of me at the top of this post was taken on another little side trip to a place called Lincoln&rsquo;s Rock.  It just demonstrates the importance of perspective when you are framing a photo.  I can assure you that I was never in danger of anything more than a broken leg had I managed to somehow slip off that ledge.</p>
<h4 id="note-2">Note 2</h4>
<p>The title of this post is also an explanation for how/why the Blue Mountains got their name.  You can see there is kind of a blue haze in the background.  This is because the mountains are full of eucalyptus trees and there is enough eucalyptus oil that evaporates into the air that refraction causes the air to look a little bit bluer.  Australians also like to talk about how fresh and clear the air is in the blue mountains, in fact one enterprising Australian apparently even put blue mountain air into cans and sold it in China!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sitting by the window of our flat in Pott&rsquo;s Point with the view you see in the picture above.  (Except its morning now).   We are starting to get past the jet lag that comes from being 15 hours ahead of home base with the help of a couple of event filled days that kept us moving and awake.  Today we are going to do something more relaxing in advance of the huge new years eve celebration tonight.</p>
<p>The flat that we rented has this spectacular view of the harbor and the city skyline.  But it lacks one key ingredient for the three days we happened to be here for.  Air Conditioning!  The weather in Sydney is very unseasonably warm.  When Jane did the research we learned that the average temp is in the high 70&rsquo;s this time of year, so AC didn&rsquo;t even cross the mind.  Unfortunately our first day here the temp was nearly 100 and yesterday was mid-90&rsquo;s.  So we come home at night to a very warm place to sleep.  Luckily even the heat can&rsquo;t keep us awake come 9-10:00 at night.  I slept pretty well through the night last night so I&rsquo;m hopeful that midnight is an achievable goal.  I&rsquo;m definitely looking forward to wishing everyone a Happy New year when it is only morning of New Years eve in your time zone.</p>
<p>Our first day in Sydney we explored the Botanical Gardens and the area around the Opera House and the bridge.  It was miserably hot and we were way out of whack with jet lag, so even now, I&rsquo;m not sure how clearly I&rsquo;m remembering everything.  We had a nice lunch at a place right on Woolloomooloo bay - yes thats a real name.  Lots of things in Australia have the &lsquo;oo&rsquo; in their names.  This is a combination of Aboriginal pronunciation and the teaching  of phonics (Not sure phonics was a thing in the early 1800&rsquo;s).  After our late lunch we walked to the Opera house, we were able to get into the lobby but no further as their was an afternoon performance going on.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At this point we had planned to hike over to the bridge and go up one of the towers.  But we nearly cracked in the heat.   A short rest and some re-hydration gave us a second wind and so we continued to wander around, eventually making our way to the bridge.  We made our way to the top of the tower just 15 minutes before closing and were rewarded with some really spectacular views of the harbor!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>By this time it was after 5pm Sydney time and the middle of the night to our bodies.  Our feet were tired from walking so we gave in and grabbed a cab back to the flat.   We worked really really hard to stay awake until about 8:30.  But sleep took us, at least until about 3am!</p>

			 <p>We leave the house tomorrow morning and we won&rsquo;t be back until January 26th. (Note to would be robbers:  The house has security and is well watched by neighbors and webcams)   Jane and I have been waiting for a JTerm when I&rsquo;m not teaching so we can do our Australian adventure during their summer, and this is the year!</p>
<p>So, all of our Christmas presents are things for the trip.  We didn&rsquo;t wrap them up and put them under the tree because we leave the 27th and we each got a new roll-aboard for the trip.  We had to test-pack and re-pack to make sure we could make it.  This is the new travelling ultra-light experiment and I have to say I am pretty excited about it.  Once you do a bit of reading and planning it turns out to be pretty easy to travel for four weeks with nothing but a light roll-aboard and a daypack.  Yes I&rsquo;m a regular poster child for <a href="http://www.ospreypacks.com">Osprey Packs</a></p>

<p>Its funny that the most difficult decision for me was to decide on the tech that I am bringing.  I&rsquo;ve gone back and forth between Macbook Pro (2016 13 inch edition) Plus iPad mini to 12.9 inch iPad pro plus Kindle Voyager.  Amazingly there is only 300 grams difference in weight between the iPad Pro and the new Macbook Pro.  However, I&rsquo;m really excited about the experiment of writing daily blog posts with nothing but the iPad Pro.</p>
<p>I think I have the ideal setup (for a Geek like me) with <a href="https://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a> plus a dedicated server for my blog and Jenkins which will detect and automatically rebuild every time I commit a new post!  I&rsquo;ll be Syncing photos from my Sony 𝛂6000 to my iPad and then writing posts with iA Writer.  when Working Copy pushes them to my github repository, Jenkins swings into action and runs Pelican to rebuild the static website that is my Blog.  (I know because I&rsquo;m practicing on this post)</p>
<p>We are very excited for this trip and feeling no guilt because Josh is off on a JTerm adventure to Italy and Kaia is, well, married and on her own :-) (sorry Kaia)  I&rsquo;ll be posting about our adventures here regularly, so stay tuned.</p>

<p>We are on I-94 heading across North Dakota today, the amount of road construction almost makes us long for Hwy 2 in Montana.  Our anticipated day of uninterrupted four lane travel has been marred numerous times already by lane closures that stretch on for 12 miles apiece.  We are hoping to make it all the way to Minneapolis today and turn in the RV about 12 hours early.  If the going is too slow we can spend one more night on the road and bring it in tomorrow morning, but I think we are all settled in for the final push.  Its been a great trip, better than any of us anticipated.  We all agreed that there is a lot of appeal to traveling by RV.</p>
<p>The other night around the campfire we were reminiscing about our anniversary adventures:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>5 year - a week in Door County, young new parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10 year - a cruise aboard a Carnival Funship!  Once on Carnival is enough, and an infamous catamaran trip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>15 year - a Mediterranean cruise on Royal Caribbean, exhausting!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>20 year - Cruising the Hawaiian islands on Norwegian, injuries galore, getting saved by a lifeguard, and losing bicycle breaks on the way down the mountain!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>25 year - Alaskan cruise on Princess plus an extended trip to Denali, whales and bears and moose!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>30 year - RV trip to Banff and Glacier, fun and very relaxed. (but scarce wildlife)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That is a quite a list of cool places to visit, and a lot of years of great friendship!  None of us had really though about how many cruises the list included, so it was definitely time for a land adventure.   Who knows where our next adventure will take us in five years.  If we all make it to our 50th anniversary what will  we do then?  We&rsquo;ll all be in our early 70&rsquo;s by then, so chances are slim that we&rsquo;ll make a return to mountain hiking.  But, who knows by the 70 will be the new 50.  Whatever the case may be we are lucky to have such great lifelong friends.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;m finishing up this last post of the vacation just 160 miles from Minneapolis.  Today has been a wild day of quick stops for gas, Burger King takeout (our first fast food of the trip) and switching drivers at rest stops or an off ramp.  We are <em>mostly</em> out of the windy North Dakota, Northwest Minnesota winds, in fact we have a nice tail wind pushing along now.</p>
<p>As I have said many times before travel always changes me, or gives me a new perspective.  My world of computer science is pretty clean and indoors.  It was great to get out and appreciate the natural world.  Its sad to see how the glaciers are receding and I hope we have the will to do something about climate change.  On the other hand it was very hopeful to see how people in both Canada and the United States treat the national parks.  You can tell that the people who visit have a certain reverence for the parks and what they represent.  They are clean and free of litter, people that you meet on the trails are generally smiling and greet you in a friendly way.   It definitely makes me want to continue to explore the great things our national parks have to offer.</p>

			 <p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/81d44fa9a2.jpg" alt="Ptarmigan Falls"></p>
<p>We were just passed Ptarmigan Falls on our way back down when from behind me I heard, &ldquo;Oh Crap!!&rdquo; I thought Brian must have hurt himself so I asked &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; He said &ldquo;I just remembered I have the keys to the RV!&rdquo; Uh Oh!  I thought, Jane and Holly are not going to be too happy when we get back.  We had started the hike together that morning going as far as Ptarmigan Falls.  At the falls we decided that the guys would continue on to Iceberg Lake, while the women returned to the campsite at their own leisurely pace.  Nobody thought about the one and only key to unlock Willard when we parted ways.  The rest of the hike we brainstormed ways that Jane and Holly would break in to the RV, we had visions of Jane boosting Holly through the front screen window, or failing that to recruit one of the small neighbor kids for that duty.  Alternatively we figured they were just over at the Swiftcurrent Motor Inn cooling off and using the free WiFi.  It turned out that they did use the WiFi, but we found them in good spirits lounging in the shade outside the RV waiting for us.</p>
<p>Although the hike out to Iceberg Lake and back was a good 10.2 miles and our longest of the trip, it was definitely worth the effort.  Iceberg lake is part of a <em>cirque</em>.  What is a cirque you ask? It is a half-open steep-sided hollow at the head of a valley or on a mountainside, formed by glacial erosion.  Think of a giant ice cream scoop digging out half a mountain and you get the idea.  The image doesn&rsquo;t really capture it, but gives you an idea.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/97a929d31f.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Our trip to Iceberg Lake was entertaining due mostly to two little boys hiking ahead of us.  Boundless energy and a total willingness to get wet at every opportunity.  At one point we caught up with them at a small stream where one of them was dunking his sweaty little head into the rushing water.  His father, of course, was egging him on and taking pictures of the thing.  Instant brain freeze was all we could think about.   A while later they caught up with us at Iceberg Lake, which really does have icebergs floating around.  One of them was just close enough to shore to be really really tempting for these two.  The shoes were off and they were hopping from rock to rock determined to get to the little iceberg and claim in for their kingdom.  The water was cold, REALLY COLD, so they were not willing to wade in above their ankles or for more than just a few seconds.  We left before they claimed the berg, but we were convinced it was just a matter of time before one of them got completely soaked!  We did catch this picture of a young brit who had brought his swimtrunks along on the hike for the purpose of getting in the lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slow Down!&rdquo; Ok, this was not delivered in the sing-songy spirit of the Simon and Garfunkel hit by the same name.  Despite the fact that I was only going 15 miles per hour, apparently it was uncomfortable to those in the back.  I&rsquo;m not surprised as it was not a great, no, not even a good road.  It was a crappy road 12 miles long to get back to the Many Glacier campground.  A place that I had heard in my head the entire trip as the &ldquo;Mini-Glacier Campground&rdquo; was imagining something on the order of a snow cone.  Tonight was to be our first RV night &ldquo;boondocking it&rdquo; No electrical, no water, no sewer.  We switched into full conservation mode.  The worst thing was we were also in a no generator zone so we couldn&rsquo;t even make coffee in the morning.  It really wasn&rsquo;t that bad as we just walked over the the store with our travel mugs and got some.</p>
<p>We started out yesterday with our rental car and headed back up to Logan&rsquo;s pass.  One day ago it was shrouded in clouds, fog, and rain.  But today the skies were sunny with just a few puffy clouds to make things interesting.  What a difference a day makes.  The sunshine gives Glacier a whole different look.  I can&rsquo;t even say better because despite the overcast weather of the day before it was still really cool.  But, once we got to Logan&rsquo;s pass we were set to make the hike to hidden lake.  A hike in the snow!!  Its June 26 and we are hiking in the snow!  Layers People!  We started with a lot of layers and ended up with short sleeves!</p>

<p>Today was, by far, the nicest day of our trip so far, with clear skies and highs in the mid 70&rsquo;s!  We started out in shorts and short sleeves today.  The <em>plan</em> was to make today an easy day, saving our energy for tomorrow&rsquo;s hike to Iceberg Lake (or Ptarmigan Falls).  Instead we did 7.2  miles around Swiftcurrent, Josephine and Grinnell lakes.  The thing about hiking is that you always feel fine when you make the bad decision that takes you just a little bit further than your feet would like to go!</p>

<p>In keeping with the theme of this post, it is also clear that I am not a good person to lead the hikers. My stride is too long and my pace is too fast.  &ldquo;Slow Down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As we got in the car to head over to the hot tub at the KOA in St. Mary&rsquo;s Montana, I pointed to the rope tied to the rear view mirror of the RV and the picnic table.  I said it looks like we tied the RV to the picnic table to keep it from blowing away!  Ha, imagine a picnic table holding back a 32 foot Winnebago in a 25 mph wind!?  But 20 - 25 mph winds are what you get in St. Marys, just east of the continental divide.  We had a lot of wind all day yesterday and today as we drove from Banff to Glacier.  This area is known for its wind and highway 22 even had signs with warning lights for RVs and trucks for days when the wind is gusting and dangerous!  Thankfully it was not bad for us at the time we drove that stretch.</p>
<p>Now, we are in a KOA campground, a source of some discontent amongst the group.  however it has a hot tub, pool, and laundry facilities.  These are all good things after a week of traveling together.  Plus they also rent cars that you can take on the road to the sun.  This is good as our RV would never be allowed to attempt the journey.  The roads are indeed very narrow, and the rocks overhang on one side and would definitely tear off parts of the RV!</p>
<p>This morning we got up and were on our way by about 8:00 on the &ldquo;road to the sun&rdquo;. The main problem was that the sun was not cooperating!  When we got to Logan&rsquo;s pass we could barely see in front of the car because we were right in the middle of the clouds.  But, we kept on going and in the end we were rewarded, not with sunshine, but with &ldquo;lord of the rings&rdquo; mystical beauty.  The above photo is from MacDonald&rsquo;s Lodge.  Although the national park is called glacier, it could more appropriately be called waterfall national park at this point!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/78bef30902.jpg" alt="Waterfall"></p>
<p>After MacDonald&rsquo;s Lodge we took the Avalanche Lake hike!   Wow, was this pretty, even in the dripping rain the sites along the way and once we got to the lake were well worth the hike!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c4d086e63c.jpg" alt="Avalanche Lake"></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bbd5935a92.jpg" alt="Avalanche Lake"></p>
<p>After the hike we headed back the other direction on the road to the sun and by this time the clouds had lifted enough for us to really enjoy the scenery!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bf2b86df48.jpg" alt="Glacier Valley"></p>
<p>Of course no trip to Glacier, in June, would be complete without photos of the giant snowdrifts-cum-glaciers that we humans plow out of the way for the tourists!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2425a46da1.jpg" alt="Avalanche Lake"></p>
<p>And finally, no trip to Glacier would be complete without a picture of Goose Island!</p>

<p>&ldquo;A clean underwear!&rdquo; came the shout from the bedroom of the RV.  &ldquo;Thanks Holly, you just provided me with the opening line for today&rsquo;s blog.&rdquo;  After a morning of touring the sites on the road to Jasper, we are back in the RV, having lost our will to hike in the rain.  In the gloom and rain of the day I would say that the Columbia Ice sheet and all of the surrounding glaciers was actually a little depressing.  You just can&rsquo;t help but see how much they have shrunk over the years, and we overheard people talking.  &ldquo;When I was here 20 years ago, this glacier came right up to the road.&rdquo; Now the glacier in question is a good kilometer back from the road.</p>
<p>So, as we are taking this downtime to shower and cleanup a bit in preparation for our move south tomorrow, I&rsquo;m taking a few minutes this afternoon to catch up a little.  There is only so much you can write about all of this mountain beauty.  On the other hand it seems as though just when we think we&rsquo;ve seen the most beautiful site, something new comes along and surprises us.  so I&rsquo;m just going to include some pictures today with a minimum amount of commentary.  I think they speak for themselves.</p>
<p>The photo at the top is from Bow Lake, right off the highway.  But everything was so still it was crazy beautiful.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e357505b06.jpg" alt="Close up Reflection"></p>
<p>This one may trip you up a bit.  It is a closeup of the mountain reflection, but the stones in the foreground are not a reflection.  It looks kind of weird without the perspective of the real landscape!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/541d52ba14.jpg" alt="Peyto lake"></p>
<p>This is Peyto Lake, just a short hike off the highway, it is well worth the stop!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/3ac0fcf740.jpg" alt="Sunwapta Falls"></p>
<p>Sunwapta Falls was another really short hike off the highway, with spectacular falls.  The power of the water never ceases to amaze. I was messing around with shutter speeds to get the effect you see in this photo.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f9255dd999.jpg" alt="Emerald Lake"></p>
<p>We hiked around Emerald lake, I think you can guess how it got its name.  Emerald Lake is in Yoho national park in British Columbia.  If I had written this post yesterday I would have titled it &ldquo;Yoho, Yoho a Pirates Life for Me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6a54a75e5a.jpg" alt="Natural Bridge"></p>
<p>Another beautiful waterfall, next to a spot you could easily drive by and dismiss.  But well worth the stop.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/696066008e.jpg" alt="Natural Bridge"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s another which gives you a better view of its bridge like qualities.</p>

<p>Happy Anniversary!  Jane and I have been married 30 years today.  People will say that is quite an accomplishment these days, I just can&rsquo;t believe that 30 years have gone by so quickly.  We have two amazing children that have grown into wonderful young adults.  Yes, one of them is older than we were when we got married.  We have had 30 years of incredible adventures, we have seen a pretty good fraction of the world, and are looking forward to seeing lots more of it.  I&rsquo;ve had a pretty great career doing what I love.  I couldn&rsquo;t have done any of it without Jane.  Thanks honey!</p>
<p>We started today at Moraine Lake, its smaller than Lake Louise, and when you walk up to the waters edge you might think, meh, not as blue as Louise either.  But if you climb up the rocks near the waters edge you don&rsquo;t have to go very far before you realize its just a matter of perspective.  Of course climbing the rocks was part of the fun, but once we got to the top we realized there was a much easier way to get there!  After absorbing the view for a while we made our way down (the easy way) and did a short walk along the lake shore.  The sun started to come out, so we made our way back up and you can see how different the colors are in the sunlight!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/a617f534ae.jpg" alt="Moraine Sun"></p>
<p>From Moraine Lake we headed down the Bow River Parkway towards Banff.  Supposedly the wildlife is more plentiful along the parkway that the four lane freeway.  There are so many places you could stop and hike or stop and view the scenery that we really had to pick and choose.  Our main stop on the way down was at Johnston Canyon.  We hiked our way up to the lower falls and were rewarded with some really great views.  I&rsquo;m always amazed at the power of these streams and waterfalls.  You can really appreciate the power of water over the centuries as you see how this deep narrow canyon was formed by the water.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/0bae0fa319.jpg" alt="Johnston Canyon"></p>
<p>By now it was lunch time and we headed for downtown Banff.  Our first goal was for lunch, with a strong subgoal of finding a place where we could watch the USA versus Argentina soccer match later.  We found ourselves at Park Distillery.  They had the Euro on TV, but unfortunately they did not get FS1.  Apparently with Canada not part of the Copa FS1 is not a priority in Banff, as this became a real theme as we went from place to place.  First everyone assured us they got soccer, but when I clarified that we wanted the Copa America tournament, not the Euro things went downhill.  After receiving multiple assurances that the Bear Street tavern did indeed get the Copa, we decided we were safe and could be about our business.</p>
<p>Our next stop of the day was the Banff Hot Springs.  I will admit this seemed a bit cheesy to me, but after a few days of hiking who can resist a nice hot soak.  You can rent everything you need at the Banff Hot Springs, including historical bathing suits.  Holly <em>should</em> have done this as she forgot a critical part of her top back in the RV.  Leaving her with a slightly thin top.  Despite my reservations, and the fact the Hot Springs really were nothing more than a a big swimming pool full of hot mineral water the soak felt great, and we all got an extra shower!  The quote of the day, was in the car on the way to the Banff Hotel when Holly was having further wardrobe problems and was heard to say &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find them!&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="/images/Canyon/hot_springs.jpeg" alt="Hot Springs"></p>
<p>After a short tour of the Banff Hotel, we headed back downtown for some shopping and wandering around town.  Basically wasting time until the game started.  At 6:30 we headed over to the Bear Street Tavern to take up our seats and wait for the game to start, only to be told that it would be an hour and a half wait for a table with no guarantee of seeing a TV.  Horrors!  Fine then, off we go to the Pump and Tap tavern.  Described by the hostess of the Park Distillery as &ldquo;a dive bar&rdquo;. But being that it was an English pub they did get the game. In fact the owner had purchased a package just this week to ensure that they would get the Copa.  No credit cards accepted, no table service, but lots of TVs and some decent beer.  They had a very short menu with a number of deep fried options.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/49d18d88fa.jpg" alt="Pump and Tap"></p>
<p>Just before halftime we got a text from Bear Street that our table was available.  Brian went to investigate.  Site lines to the TV?  Copa available?  As it turned out there was a view of the TV, but they did not have the package that allowed them to see the Copa.  We were at the only place in town that carried the game.  As time wore on, more and more USA fans filed in to watch the game.  Then Messi kicked that wondrous free kick to put Argentina up 2 - 0 and all we could do was be impressed at how good the guy is.  Right after halftime Argentina went up 3 - 0 and our stomachs said we should find some good food, so we made our table available to more diehard USA fans and headed down the street to the Coyote Cafe.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t arrive back at the RV until after 9:30 which meant that it was a 12 hour day of touring and enjoying the sites around Banff.</p>

<p>Sitting in our campsite in Banff, my feet are up, I have a Gin &amp; Tonic next to me, the campfire is started, the sun is still high in the sky, it&rsquo;s 18:00.  My iPhone tells me that I have taken 35,196 steps and gone 14.6 miles today!  I believe the G&amp;T is well earned. We are thinking of ordering pizza from Temple Pizza at the Fairmont hotel on Lake Louise because NOBODY WANTS TO GET OUT OF THEIR CHAIR!!</p>
<p>The first thing to say, is that today is totally a gift!  The forecast was calling for rain but today was absolutely beautiful!  Sunny and nice all day long.  We had a perfect view of the mountains and everything else around Lake Louise today.</p>
<p>The day started out cool, with temps down to 35 overnight.  Its OK, as Willard has a furnace to keep us nice and comfortable.  But we all totally overdressed for the hike today, as I think it got well above the advertised high of 67 degrees.  We thought this was our warmup hike of only 10K round trip.  So Brian and I said we would ride our bikes up the road to Lake Louise.  According to our best information it was only supposed to be 200 meters of elevation over 4 kilometers of distance.  A slope of only 1/20. Someone Lied!  it was 4k of straight up hill, lets just say we were warmed up by the time we got to the lake!</p>
<p>We took the obligatory, but still totally beautiful,  pictures at the the Chateau and then we headed out for our hike to the Tea House in the Six Glaciers Plain.  Six is definitely and overstatement, and if anyone thinks that global warming is a &ldquo;hoax&rdquo; they are idiots.  If you think global warming is a hoax, I&rsquo;m sorry if I&rsquo;ve offended you, but science is not a matter of opinion. Science is based on observation and analysis and the evidence shows that the glaciers are MUCH SMALLER than they were 100 years ago.  Why would glaciers be smaller?  Higher average temperatures.</p>
<p>Anyway, the hike was still beautiful, and Brian even managed to see a chunk of glacier break off and fall off the cliff.  The rest of us heard it, but by then it was too late!</p>

<p>It was difficult to get out of bed this morning.  The rain was making rainy sounds on the roof and there was a chill in the air.  Windows were cracked open an it was only in the 40&rsquo;s outside.  Someone had to get up and start the coffee.  Also, it seemed like a great time to try the heater.  I&rsquo;m not sure it had been used before as it had that new furnace smell to it as it warmed up our little home.  This got everyone out of bed and eating breakfast.  It is Father&rsquo;s day today.  I&rsquo;ve had electronic wishes  from both Kaia and Josh.</p>
<p>Even in the rain our departure was pretty easy.  Unplug, retract, and go.  It was rainy and windy as we left the campsite, the rain ended pretty quickly but the wind hounded us all the way past Calgary.  We had quite the experience of refueling at the Costco gas station!    We pulled off Highway 1 expecting an easy (and cheap) experience only to find the lines 6 cars deep.  Thankfully there was a nice guy directing traffic who got us over to the line for the end pump.  It could have been a real disaster trying to make the turn out of the station if we didn&rsquo;t have the extra room.  We are finding that we are limited to $150 worth of gas which seems to be about half a tank!!  We can go from 1/4 to 3/4 on a $150 charge.</p>
<p>Outside of Calgary we left the plains of Alberta and climbed into the beautiful Canadian Rockies!  We are really getting the hang of setting up camp.  Less than five minutes today.  We&rsquo;ll have to move our campsite by about 30 feet tomorrow as we are camped next to the site we have reserved for the next few days.  After a quick lunch in the RV we decided to take a bike ride to the Village for some ice and then hike along the Bow River.  As you can see the scenery is pretty nice!</p>

<p>This morning we left the Pratt&rsquo;s at 8:00, right on schedule.  I took my first shift in the cockpit.  This thing drives pretty nicely except when the wind gets gusty.  Then you feel like you are constantly overcorrecting one way or the other.  As we buzzed along I94 through North Dakota, we realized that we were not really in the spirit of things.  No large balls of twine, no giant ears of corn!  Of course, there&rsquo;s an app for that!  &ldquo;Road Trippers&rdquo; to the rescue!  In no time at all we learned that Jamestown had the worlds largest buffalo monument.  After a quick stop at Cenex to top off our tank (38 gallons for about half a tank),  we ended up on a really bad gravel road that brought us into the frontier village from the wrong direction.   Oh well, we got there.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e029c4eb68.jpg" alt="Pratts"></p>
<p>Now we are headed towards Bizmark for lunch and maybe a glimpse of the worlds largest Holstein!  Wait, how much giant bovine statuary can we see in one day?!  We shall see&hellip; the Holstein is reportedly some 40 feet tall and 50 feet long.</p>
<p>Picking up the story a bit later, we have crossed the border into Canada!  A relatively painless and friendly process.  When the border guard asked if we would be staying in Canada long term, we told her it depended on the outcome of the election.  She smiled and said she was hearing that a lot.  Its 4:30 now, and we have another hour to go before we get to Weyburn for the night.  We are not making quite as fast progress as we thought but its been a pretty easy day except for the gusty winds.  I&rsquo;ve taken my second shift driving, and it was definitely much better heading into the wind than having it directly across this big beast.</p>
<p>There is not much scenery yet, just a lot of wide open spaces and oil wells.  At one point we saw big big numbers on the side of the hills outlined in stone.  I suspected it was UFO markings &ndash;  the infamous &ldquo;area 15&rdquo;, Brian thought they were targets for bombing practice from the Air Force base.  Holly looked it up on Google and learned that it was a local high school tradition to spell out their graduation year in rock on one of the local hills.</p>
<p>We crossed into the mountain time zone just before we got to Weyburn, Saskatchewan for the night, which meant that we were right on schedule for happy hour.  I like this RV style of camping, it took us less than 10 minutes to level up, connect the electricity and the water.  We rolled out the canopy and set up our soccer chairs poured drinks, and by 5:15 we were relaxing and enjoying our campsite.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/3fb795bd4f.jpg" alt="Camping"></p>
<p>For dinner we took the bikes into town, and ended up at Boston Pizza.  Jane and Holly both ordered a Bloody Caesar (like a Bloody Mary but Canadian). The waitress offered &ldquo;fishbowl size&rdquo; little did we know that they would actually be served in a fish bowl!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8c6dfdbb60.jpg" alt="Bloody Caesars"></p>
<p>We are on the road this morning having successfully navigated the dumping station!  More on that later.</p>

			 <p>Mobile blogging!  Her is my view as I write this post.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/d8fc15bf5d.jpg" alt="looking ahead"></p>
<p>Where to start?  We awoke this morning and split our preparatory duties.  The women went to Costco, the men took Tucker back home and picked up the rest of the knutson&rsquo;s belongings.  By 1:00 we had two SUVs FULL Of stuff to put in our 32 foot Winnebago, henceforth known as Willard.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8a2c1a63f0.jpg" alt="full car"></p>
<p>We arrived at Rent and Travel just before 2:00, our appointed time to take possession of Willard.  After about 30 minutes (only) of introduction and education (which we recorded for later reference) we began the 90 minute process of moving in.  Food, lawn games, photography equipment, adult beverages, hiking gear, clothing, bedding, adult beverages, grilling equipment.  All the comforts of home for the next 15 days and 2,800 miles.  It was hot sweaty work, but we are all packed up and on the road.  Jane, of course, is taking the first shift of driving this giant beast.  Brian is riding shotgun and Holly and I are trying out RV travel in the back.  I&rsquo;m sitting at the kitchen table writing as we go.  I just saw the sign that says Morehead 198 that is our destination for the evening.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll be parking at the home of our friends Dave and Carol Pratt tonight.  Dave just texted us that he was going to get some beer and put some ribs on the grill to slow cook for us.  We should be in Morehead by around 7:30 for our practice night of leveling, setting up, and trying things out without a lot of neighboring campers watching us mess around.</p>

<p>In preparation for our big RV adventure Brian, Holly, Jane and I all attended the Minnesota United FC match tonight.  The match was played against Sporting KC as part of the open tournament, similar to the FA cup in England.  We arrived early to check out the food trucks and the atmosphere around the stadium that the regulars refer to as the Nessi (National Sports Center NSC, get it?).</p>
<p>As we were enjoying our Bahn Mi sandwiches and a nice Summit EPA a dude dressed as a blue dinosaur/shark with a megaphone came to stand beside us.  He proceeded to start heckling the Sporting KC keeper and his coach, as they were going through their pregame drills.  We thought it was a bit odd that he sounded pretty normal when he was chatting with other people (obviously he&rsquo;s a regular at the games) but his heckling voice had a definite Scottish brogue to it.  As the Sporting KC players were taking their shots on goal we noticed that the last of the shots were all going over the bar and getting increasingly close to this guy (and us). The final shot was right on target as it hit him right in the megaphone.  Later we learned that he was sort of a mascot called Nessi.  Apparently the Loch Ness monster must look like a blue dino.  It all makes sense now, even the Scottish accent.</p>
<p>The first half of the game was a bit boring to be honest.  The ref seemed content to let pretty much everything go with nothing but a stern talking to, the Loons had no shots on goal, no corners and no points.</p>
<p>Things picked up a lot in the second half, including the referees use of the yellow card.  There should have been a red as on of the KC players attacked a MUFC player from behind.  Then KC scored first on a very dubious handball in the box.  I hate it when a player goes down and they call a handball on that player when the ball hits the arm on the ground.  Sacrifice your face and let yourself fall on your nose so you don&rsquo;t get a handball.   Benny Fielhaber took the PK and made it 1 - nil for KC.  Suddenly the game came to life.  The Loons definitely started to get more of the ball and went on the attack much more often.  KC seemed to get more and more aggressive with their tackles as the guys in green let them play while punishing the Minnesotans for even the most minor of infractions.  Eventually their evil ways caught up with them and Minnesota was awarded a PK for a really vicious tackle in the box.  1-1, game on.</p>
<p>Regular time ended in a draw so we went to overtime.   KC seemed to find another  gear and I had the sense that it was only a matter of time until they scored and put the game away.  Which they did only to have the goal ruled out for offsides.  A few minutes later they came back and scored again.  Minnesota tried desperately to get back in it, but never really got a shot on target to level things out.</p>

			 <p>Blaise Schaeffer, my former student for all of 3 weeks, is on a cross country bike journey. He was riding right past my lake house on Bone Lake, and so I got to participate in his adventure for 40 miles! It was awesome.</p>
<p>Blaise started the day in North Branch Minnesota, and texted me when he got to Balsam Lake WI, I texted him back that I would meet him at Jonzy&rsquo;s Market and we would go from there. The plan was to ride to Cumberland where we would be picked up by his mom Deb. But she was running a bit behind schedule so rather than hang around the Cumberland quick trip for an hour we extended our ride to Haugen Wisconsin.  You’ll probably have to look that one up on a map.  That made it a 41 mile ride for me and about 80 for Blaise.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It was a great chance to ride and talk to Blaise about everything he’s seen and done on this trip.  You should check out his blog to get an idea:  <a href="http://blaise2s.com" title="Blaise2s.com">blaise2s.com</a>.  He told me about many of the amazing hosts he has had along the way due to the <a href="http://www.warmshowers.org">Warm Showers</a> network.  Warm Showers is an online community of cyclists and hosts who are willing to have people like Blaise stay in their home overnight while they are on a long distance cycle adventure.  Great idea!</p>

			 <p>The Bucket Dive</p>
<p>According to our dive logs it&rsquo;s been 13 years since we did our last dive.  So, when we decided to make a last minute trip to the Caribbean for Spring Break this year we decided that one of our activities should be a refresher dive to get current.  This turned out to be a great decision.  We thought that doing the refresher early in the cruise would be good, since it would allow us the flexibility of doing a second dive later on.  The bonus was that the Bucket Regatta was happening in St. Bart&rsquo;s so the dive turned into a dive plus several hours in a Zodiac &ldquo;chasing the race&rdquo;   Wow!!</p>
<p>We arrived at the pier at 9:30 and we were greeted by a French woman, Isabelle.  She was busy unpacking tanks and BV&rsquo;s etc, but was very friendly.  We asked if we needed to do any paperwork, assuming the standard waivers etc.  &ldquo;No, we are French&rdquo; she said as if that was all the explanation we needed.  We were joined by a dozen other French speaking people, all much younger than us. When did this happen?  We used to be the younger ones on these adventures!  It was totally unclear which of them were assistants, and which of them were other guests like us.  After getting everyone organized, Emmanuel, the Captain, told us that we would be diving with Elizabeth.  &ldquo;Who is Elizabeth?&rdquo;  I asked.  &ldquo;She is the blonde Woman, my wife.   my wife&rdquo; he said with a grin.   The refresher turned out to be just the perfect amount of review.  It&rsquo;s just like riding a bike Isabelle told us. She was right.  After a few minutes we were enjoying the freedom of exploring the reef.</p>
<p>Under water we saw, a couple of Barracuda, a sea turtle napping in a little alcove, a bunch of HUGE lobster, and a couple of grouchy eels.  We also saw the usual assortment of Tangs and Wrasse, Parrotfish and Lionfish.  After a slow start, my ears started to clear a bit easier and I made it down 60 feet.  A very good dive.  A day later, as I write this I&rsquo;m still waiting for my inner ears to clear, which is a problem I had 13 years ago.  It&rsquo;s not painful, just a bit unpleasant to hear the world a bit muffled.</p>
<p>With the diving done, the next part of our adventure was just getting started.  As usual, I guess I hadn&rsquo;t really been paying attention, but the bonus part of our dive was that we were now going to &ldquo;chase the race.&rdquo;  We knew that there was a huge regatta happing on St. Bart&rsquo;s, but to follow the sailboats in our Zodiac was a real experience.  First, the beauty of these huge boats is just amazing.  With the sun gleaming off the huge white sails they were really spectacular.  It was shocking to watch them fly past us completely silently, listing 30 degrees or more with their sails full of wind.  As you can see these were not small inexpensive sailboats either, these were big luxury boats!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/b81e27f084.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In addition to the excitement of chasing the boats, and it is really interesting how close we got to several of them, 30 - 60 feet probably.  Close enough to greet the crew!  But the swells today made for a pretty fun boat ride.  Its always a little weird when you are in the boat look up at the tops of the waves!  Emmanuel was clearly having fun driving and getting us airborn.  Isabelle kept giving him the kind of stern look that says, &ldquo;maybe you want to slow down a bit?&rdquo; But he didn&rsquo;t seem to notice, and we didn&rsquo;t really mind.</p>
<p>In total we made a complete circle of the island, and when we made our turn to go with the wind, and &ldquo;surf the waves&rdquo; for a smooth ride home we were also rewarded with the site of one of the big ships letting out its spinnaker!  Up it went, and then Boom!  the sail filled with the wind that would propel it toward the finish line.  You just can&rsquo;t believe how big those sails are until you are right there when they go up.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6a0e82b781.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Soon after that we were back at the pier and unloading our gear.  Sunburned and very tired from a day in the sun and water.  We had to hike the long way back around the bay to get to our pickup with the ships tender, and we realized then how intense the sun was.  We just missed the tender as we came within site, but 15 minutes later they were back and without waiting an extra minute we were on our way back to the SeaDream I.</p>
<p>Somehow we managed to stay awake until dinner time at 7:30, and we chose to eat outside.  Jane had Lobster and I had a really delicious Veal Saltimbocca.  We were joined by our new friends from Florida and had a very nice dinner.  We are definitely enjoying our time here on the SeaDream.</p>

			 <h1 id="no-easy-solutions">No Easy Solutions</h1>
<p>If you were king how would you end poverty? Not an easy question to
answer, even if you were king <strong>with a magic wand</strong> its not an easy
problem to solve. Neverthless it was a question that one of our intrepid
students put to a Stanford professor one day. This became a common
question that we asked almost everyone we met with, and it was a
question that generated a lot of good group conversation. I would like
to summarize a few of the answers we heard and add my own half-baked
idea at the end.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago we visited Dr. David Grusky at the Stanford Center for
Poverty and inequality. I took away a couple of key points from this
meeting. One of their key tasks is to get better and more frequent data
about poverty in the United States. Larry told us that the data we have
today is collected too infrequently and by the time the data is
published it is nine months out of date! Wow, thats crazy. The software
development manager in me says, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t fix what you can&rsquo;t
measure&rdquo; If we are not measuring poverty how can we hope to make
progress toward fixing it. Hint: We can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In terms of a big solution Dr. Grusky expressed his idea quite
eloquently. &ldquo;We have to make everyone live together.&rdquo; At first I
rejected the idea as overly simple and impractical. But the more I
thought about it the more I liked it. Making people of all income levels
live next to each other would surely build community, where we would not
see each other as &ldquo;other&rdquo; but rather as friends and neighbors. Who
doesn&rsquo;t want to help their neighbors? Who is my neighbor is a question
that has been nagging us since the disciples first asked the question of
Jesus a couple thousand years ago. The more we live in community the
more we see each other as people.</p>
<p>To return to the theme of Decorah in the previous post, I think this
really is one of the strengths of a small town. Rich people, middle
income people, and poor people all live together. Maybe not next door,
but definitely on the same block. Our kids go to the same schools and
participate on the same teams and choirs and bands together. We meet
parents over the common ground of our kids and their achievements. Over
the years one of the most amazing aspects of the Decorah schools to me
is that there is such a high level of mutual respect among students no
matter what they do. The &ldquo;jocks&rdquo; are also in the choir, and if not
they scertainly support the choir, and vice versa. Its this kind of
integration that leads to great things. If you don&rsquo;t believe me I&rsquo;ll
tell you that Decorah has won the Iowa Challenge cup so many times in
the last ten years that people at the state just call it the &ldquo;Decorah
prize.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is this so important? The more integrated we become, and the more
we see each other as friends and peers the more we will help each
other solve our problems. The more integrated we live the more our
kids go to the same schools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In broad terms the next set of solutions revolve around <strong>economic
mobility</strong>, that is how do we get people to move up the economic ladder?</p>
<p>One answer to this question that came up several times was around
education. Even our own president Carlson took a shot at this question
at an alumni event we attended. Education leads to opportunity and or
the ability to move up the economic ladder. <a href="https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/privilege-and-inequality-in-silicon-valley-92d455b66860">Here&rsquo;s a great story that
illustrates</a>
Of course not everyone gets to go to Stanford and tap into the amazing
group of VC&rsquo;s and successful entrepreneurs that are part of the
Stanford alumni network. But education opens many doors to higher paying
jobs no matter where it comes from. The theme of education was also
evident at the <a href="http://www.creativecommons.org">Creative Commons</a> where
we discussed open source licensing models and how organizations like
Open MIT and others are making high quality courseware available on the
web. This of course is not unlike what we are doing at
<a href="http://runestoneinteractive.org">Runestone</a>.</p>
<p>Another really interesting discussion about economic mobility comes from
<a href="http://kiva.org">Kiva</a> . While Kiva has been making loans abroad for a
few years, Kiva has started to make micro loans (up to $10,000) right
here in the United States. The Kiva story goes something like this. A
micro loan is not going to vault you up the economic ladder, it may not
even get you onto the first rung. But it <strong>will</strong> give you a foothold on
the ladder where you might just be able to reach the first rung with a
little time and experience. Without the microlending infrastructure in
place, we wondered how Kiva decides who to loan to. The answer is
simple, &ldquo;If you can show us that you have convinced 25 people to loan
you 25 dollars then we will put you on the site.&rdquo; Between Kiva and the
Miller Center for Social Entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University we
have enough examples of these small scale loans in action to make it
very believable that it is a path up the economic ladder.</p>

<p>We began our outing to Rome with a walkabout starting at our hotel. The
hotel, Smeraldo, was very conveniently located just two blocks from
Piazza Fiori, and from there a quick walk to Piazza Navona and then the
Pantheon. The group shot above was taken in front of the Pantheon. We
continued our walk past the under construction Trevi fountain, and the
Spanish steps where we enjoyed a night view of the newly refurbished
fountain.</p>

<p>We have been away from the USA for 178 days. With the rulings of the
supreme court back home this week, it is easy to feel like we are
returning to a country that is better off today than it was six months
ago. We still have plenty of problems, but I am very excited to return
home. I can&rsquo;t wait to see friends and family, I may not sleep very well
tonight!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f6dac89dd1.jpg" alt="KarlÅ¡tejn Castle, Prague"></p>
<p>Today we spent the majority of our day biking from the center of Prague
to KarlÅ¡tejn Castle 35km away. We have done a bike outing in almost
every country we have visited, and today was no different. It is such a
great way to see the country side and the people.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/b26a87d743.jpg" alt="KarlÅ¡tejn View"></p>
<p>We have had an exceptional few days in Prague, mostly because of meeting
so many good friends who were experiencing Luther&rsquo;s Bach and Bonhoeffer
tour. We toured with the group dined with friends, and hosted a happy
hour for the group on our amazing terrace. It was almost like being home
with so many great people around.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c13c50b53a.jpg" alt="Biking with Biko in Prague"></p>
<p>Nevertheless tomorrow morning we board a plane in Prague that will take
us to Frankfurt and then we have a direct flight from Frankfurt to
Minneapolis. Local time to local time I&rsquo;ll be on the ground 24 hours
from now, but its really 24+7 to account for the time difference.</p>

<p>For future reference I like to record the itinerary and favorite stops
from a cruise. So here goes.</p>
<p>Azamara Journey June 12 - 23, 2015</p>
<ul>
<li>Venice, Italy</li>
<li>Dubrovnik, Croatia</li>
<li>At sea</li>
<li>Crete, Greece</li>
<li>Santorini -- hike Fira to Oia</li>
<li>Mykonos -- morning trip to Delos</li>
<li>Patmos</li>
<li>Kusadasi (Ephesus) Turkey</li>
<li>Lemnos (replaced Lesvos due to unrest)</li>
<li>Istanbul, Turkey</li>
</ul>
<p>Its hard to say what my favorite stop was on this trip. I enjoyed seeing
the old city of Dubrovnik and hiking around the walls. I enjoyed our
hike from Fira to Oia on Santorini (despite the fact that it was hot and
I complained about the heat) I enjoyed our scooter rental explorations
on Patmos. I enjoyed our tour, rug bargaining, and the evening concert
in Ephesus, I enjoyed our cooking class in Istanbul.</p>
<p>Minus the screwup on our suite, the Azamara experience was really nice
and relaxing. We enjoyed the fact that drinks were included, and so we
didn&rsquo;t have pocketsful of paper for signing for anything and
everything. We enjoyed our freedom to dine in the specialty restaurants
(Prime-C and Aqualina) whenever we wanted, and we had a great time at
the best-of-the-best night with the other suite guests. The formal table
service was a show unto itself, with all of our butlers serving us in
synchrony like the servants at Downton Abbey.</p>

<p>Since we had done all the usual tourist things during our previous visit
to Istanbul we decided to try another popular thing to do this time
around. A cooking class. Other than the kebabs we enjoyed during our
previous visit we really didn&rsquo;t get to learn that much about Turkish
cuisine so we decided to sign up for a cooking class with
<a href="www.cookistan.com">Cookistan</a></p>
<p>We took an (overpriced) cab from the docks up to the Radisson Plaza
where we met our instructor for the day along with a bunch of (much
younger) cooking enthusiasts. Our instructor, AyÅ Ä±n, was phenomenal. She
had a great sense of humor, and great timing in everything we did that
day. We started out with a walking tour of her neighborhood to get a
sense for the kinds of small shops that people use today in modern
Istanbul. When we arrived at the cooking school this was all set up for
us.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4aa1a011df.jpg" alt="Our cooking stations, all setup for us atCookistan"></p>
<p>The menu for the day can be seen on the chalk board:</p>
<ul>
<li>Suliman Soup -- Yes, I now officially like lentil soup.</li>
<li>Borecik -- a delicous meat mixture baked in pastry</li>
<li>Stuffed dried Aubergine -- even though aubergine sounds a lot
better than eggplant, I&rsquo;m still not a huge fan. Although they were
not too bad. We also used the same mixture to stuff grape leaves and
I really liked that.</li>
<li>Bulgur Salad -- Again, a new salad, and I&rsquo;m fan.</li>
<li>Circassian Style Chicken. Kind of a cold chicken salad that you can
eat with a spoon or put on bread for a sandwich.</li>
<li>Pumpkin Dessert -- Maybe the only thing all day I really didn&rsquo;t
appreciate. -- It was too much like eating sweet squash for my
palete</li>
</ul>
<p>In a very small world moment you can see the young man in this picture
with me, who works on the same team at Epic with one of my former
students!</p>

<p>The cat, of all things, stole the show. Earlier in the day we had
learned about the cats of Ephesus. Apparently the archeological team
working on the excavation of the ancient city published a book, but it
was about the cats rather than about substantial archeological issues.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ffc99662df.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>So, it was no surprise that when 500 of us had settled into the Odeon
for a 13 piece string orchestra plus harp, that the cats decided to see
what was going on. One of them decided it must have had front row seats,
as it seated itself right on top of the stone wall front and center
behind the orchestra. Then as the first piece started the cat started to
meow. Loud enough that it could be heard alongside the harp. The
orchestra got the giggles. The ship&rsquo;s staff was mortified. Too afraid
to grab the cat and drag it out of their they tried to call it (quietly)
and the head of guest services tried to shush it! Really, you do not
shush a cat. Now, I know this will come as a shock to some, but I am not
a cat lover. I barely tolerate their presence. But this was
stereotypical cat and stereotypical human behavior at its funniest. I
only wish that I had been smart enough to video the whole thing because
this is America&rsquo;s Funniest Home Videos GOLD.</p>
<p>I guess the cat was mostly a fan of the harp, because it moved on after
the harpist left the stage. From then on we could really enjoy the music
and the small orchestra. The concert was definitely a greatest hits type
of concert: Bach: Air, Boccherini: Minuet, Mozart: Eine Kliene Nacht
Musik, and Brahms: Hungarian Dance No: 5. The GÃ¼Ã§an brothers stole the
show in the final number with a Violin versus Viola duel that everyone
laughing and cheering.</p>
<p>In between all of this great music was the realization that we were
sitting in the Odeon theater of Ephesus. Built in the 2nd century AD we
sat on the same stones that Marc Antony and Cleopatra may have sat upon
when they were here. The Odeon was the center of city government, and
cultural events in early Ephesus. With the sun setting behind us it was
an evening we will not forget.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/57790de1f3.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Earlier in the day we did a private tour of Ephesus and it was amazing.
About halfway through the tour I turned to Jane and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling
a little bad we did not bring the students down here when we were in
Istanbul.&rdquo; Of all of the ancient ruins of ancient cities we have
visited this would definitely be in my top three. The terraced houses,
and the library (with its tunnel to the Brothel across the street) are
just spectacular.</p>
<p>Our last stop of the day was at the temple of Artemis. There is just one
column remaining but from there you can get a great view of this ancient
pagan temple along with a Muslim mosque and the Basilica of St. John.
Quite a combination.</p>

<p>We may have missed 2 or 3 km of paved road, but other than that we
pretty much covered the island of Patmos today. And what a great way to
cover it we discovered. Scooters! Not our usual biking fare, but the
island is very hilly and we wanted to cover more ground.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/04aa3cd6d9.jpg" alt="Scooter Selfie"></p>
<p>So, we got off the ship and made the short walk to Moto-Leo. A
distinctly family run scooter rental operation. Father and daughter,
with no deposit or arduous paperwork to rent for the day. Which the
daily rental was only 15 euro. So it was also a very cheap way to see
the island.</p>
<p>The whole island reminded us of small town living. Although Patmos is a
Christian Pilgrimage destination, and they obviously get cruise ships
stopping in, the island has not succumbed to that overly touristic
feeling. We loved it.</p>
<p>The highlight of the island is the Cave of the Apocalypse, where St.
John wrote the book of Revelations. Its pretty small, and they don&rsquo;t
let you take pictures inside, so other than saying it looked like a
small cave-like chapel there is not much more to say.</p>
<p>Above the cave sits a monastery and this was our second stop for the
day. After parking the scooters and starting the walk up the hill I
noticed something that was definitely out of place on the top of Patmos.
A &ldquo;Hawkeye Rd&rdquo; sign. Really?! An Iowa Hawkeye sign on this tiny small
island in Greece. &ldquo;Iowa Hawkeyes!&rdquo; I exclaimed. Then I met Jimmy.
&ldquo;Are you from Iowa?&rdquo; he asked? &ldquo;yes, from Decorah&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Oh,
thats just north of Independence isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Clearly this dude knew his
Iowa geography! &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Well, people from Iowa get free
coffee, come in, come in!&rdquo;</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ff41c14f45.jpg" alt="Note the Hawkeye Rd sign!"></p>
<p>We learned from Jimmy that he had lived in Iowa some 13 years until he
inherited this building, which brought him back to the island. He has a
fantastic view, and is obviously doing quite well with the restaurant
and the gift shop.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/cb4ed00071.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After doing the only two touristic things on the island we took off on
our scooters to explore the nooks and crannies of the island. We saw
lots of beautiful little secluded beaches and coves that would be
perfect for swimming or snorkeling.</p>

<p>There were six ships in the harbor at Santorini Celebrity, MSC, Azamara,
Holland America, and Saga. Azamara was definitely the smallest with just
under 700 passengers, but the Celebrity Equinox more than made up for
our size. So it was probably over 6000 people descending on the city for
the day. In response, the port officials had to stage all of the tender
operations so as to not completely overwhelm their ability to welcome
people to their city. Meaning, the gondola ride to the top and the poor
donkeys carrying people not willing to wait in line for the gondola.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c9d53bd0a5.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>One of the many nice things about the Azamara line is that we stay in
port longer than anyone else. Whereas most cruise lines will arrive at a
port around 8AM and leave by 5PM Azamara will stay until 10 or 11PM.
This has many great benefits in that you can stay ashore much longer,
and even have dinner on shore if you like. Or if you have dinner on the
ship you are doing it while the ship is anchored! It also goes a long
way to reducing the stress around getting out and back from a shore
excursion.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when we arrived on shore the line to take the cable car up
the hill stretched across the port. It looked like it was going to take
two hours just to get into town but in the end the lined moved fairly
quickly and it was only 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The island of Santorini is really just the rim of an ancient volcanic
caldera that sticks up above the water. Its easy to see the outline of
the circle in this picture:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e5b85169fa.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Our goal for the day was to escape the crowds in the city by hiking from
Fira to Oia a five mile walk along the rim of the caldera. Through all
of the white villages with their shops and hotels. It sounded pretty
easy and it didn&rsquo;t even look like a very long walk when we were
starting out. But it felt a lot longer as there was no breeze and the
temperature got up to 32 C or about 90 F. The title of this post is a
bit dramatic, as it was not that bad of a walk, and although in a few
places we walked through volcanic gravel that insisted on getting in our
shoes we had 3 hours of amazing views.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/419dc3787b.jpg" alt="The long walk to Oia"></p>
<p>When we arrived in Oia we badly needed a shower, or a dip in one of the
many pools we passed on the way. Instead we found a nice little shady
restaurant and revived ourselves with some carbonara and a glass of
wine. We had escaped the crowds of Fira, seen a lot of beautiful
scenery, and worked off a few calories hiking in the heat. It was a
great day. Yes, it felt like a forced march a few times along the path
to Oia in the heat, but as part of life&rsquo;s journeys this was worth the
effort.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back on the ship is was Azamara&rsquo;s white night night.
Everyone was out on deck dressed in white and the crew was serving a
great dinner. They had the webber kettle going and there were some great
greek kabobs and other good food. To top off the evening we watched
another great sunset over the rim of the volcano.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ea9dcfea3f.jpg" alt="Leaving Venice"></p>
<p>After a beautiful sailaway in venice we traveled to Croatia where our
first stop was Dubrovnik. This is a beautiful small city built into the
hills on the coast of the Adriatic. Our goal for seeing Dubrovnik was to
walk the walls of the old city. The walls are still intact (although
patched in places) and provide some pretty amazing views of the harbor
as well as the town.</p>
<p>You will notice that all of the homes in the picture have the same red
clay tile roofing. But if you look a bit more closely you will see that
some of them are quite new and bright while others are old and moss
covered. Sadly the new tiles vastly outnumber the old, and are an
indication that the house was bombed in the war in the 90&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>After walking the wall, which is about 1.2 miles we were a bit thirsty
so we found a bar, literally through a hole in the wall. It was shady
and we had a wonderful glass of the local white wine and just enjoyed
watching the ocean and chilling out. As you can see from the picture,
the tables and chairs are scattered over the natural rock formation and
so the waitstaff had to be quite agile.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4f6a8666f7.jpg" alt="Hole in the Wall Bar"></p>
<p>Later that night we had reservations in Prime C, one of the great
specialty restaurants aboard the Journey. As we were getting ready for
dinner we got to enjoy a spectacular sunset from the comfort of our deck
on the back of the ship.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7a126f13b1.jpg" alt="Sunset Spectacular!"></p>
<p>We have had great meals aboard the ship in Aqualina and in Prime C. Last
night was even better as we were able to attend the Chef&rsquo;s table. Where
we had an amazing meal with wines that had been paired with each course
by the sommelier. The menu consisted of Lobster and Avocado Salad with
Honig Sauvignon Blanc, Smoked Tomato Veloute with Conundrum White blend,
Surf and Turf Giant Prawn with a Braised Short Rib Croquette) with Schug
Pinot Noir, then New Potato Crusted Sea Bass with Lincourt Chardonnay
followed by International Cheeses with Toad Hollow.</p>

<p>The conversation started like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Incoming: Robert, I am not available now, and I have a funeral to go
to at 4, but I can meet at 5:15</p>
<p>Me: Sorry, wrong number no robert</p>
<p>Incoming: Oh, Thanks</p>
<p>Incoming: Did you want a boat?</p>
<p>Me: Yes, I had called about a boat, but I talked to Moreno</p>
<p>Incoming: OK, you better give me the time and details because he will
forget.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is was that our reservation to rent a boat to take around the lake
on our own was confirmed with Julia.</p>
<p>The next day we picked up our little 16 foot boat with a 40HP Honda
engine at 11AM and after confirming that I had driven a boat before I
was given very brief instructions, the location of life jackets, and off
we went. It was a great way to see part (a very small part in fact) of
the lake.</p>
<p>We cruised by the villa used in James Bond&rsquo;s Casino Royale past the
town of Magnerre by many other villas and great lake front property.</p>

			 <p>After cleaning up the flats and saying our goodbyes to all of the students Jane and I are now comfortably ensconced in Villa Monte right outside the small town of Varenna on Lake Como.  We will be here for a couple of days before driving to Venice and boarding the Azamara Journey for an eleven day cruise through the Greek Isles.</p>
<p>By design this part of the post-Malta holiday has been to read and relax, so there’s not a huge amount to write about.  But Lake Como is so beautiful that it is worth posting a few pictures from a short hike we did yesterday and some pics of the lake taken from the terrace of our apartment.</p>

<p>We are not in heavy sightseeing mode, just a few hours each day.  The rest of the time we are relaxing and eating and trying some Italian wine.  Thursday we are renting a boat and taking to the water on our own.  It makes me miss my Moomba very bad, but it will be great to get out on the water and view some of the huge villas on the lake from the water side.</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> These are my shoes.  I bought them for the great adventure of 2015, I started to wear them on January 1 when we left the USA.  According to the health app on my iPhone they now have 647 miles on them.  Much of that has been accumulated during our time in Malta and our travels around the Mediterranean with Angel, Ben, Emma, Erika, Ethan, Jenna, Katie, Meredith, Meredith, Olivia, Rachel, and Tricia, hereafter known as our kids, or our Malta students.  What started out as a funny offhand comment, referring to Jane and I as Mom and Dad has come to feel more true over the few months.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting this post on our penultimate weekend with our group, I am in Rome with Jane and Josh to take in an AS Roma football game tonight.  Some of our students are in Florence for the Nordic choir concert, and some of them are back on Malta (behaving themselves).  Its good to have a bit of physical distance to help put things in perspective.</p>
<p>I have also been reading each student&rsquo;s final journal or blog entries, and I must be turning into an old softie (good thing I have the summer to fix that) but I find myself choking up about something that each student has written.  It is true that these past few months of living and traveling together have turned us into an odd sort of family. I&rsquo;d be happy to adopt them all if I could get that guy in Marrakesh to make good on his offer of 20 camels apiece.  I’ve spent a bit of time lately looking back over all the pictures we have taken.  I put together this <a href="/galleries/MaltaGroups">gallery of our group photos.</a>  If you look at the first group photo in Malta and in Rome, and compare that to the last group photo this week, can you see the difference?  Look at the group in front of the pantheon, this group was just getting to know each other, barely acclimated to the Mediterranean time zone.  Now look at the later photos, photographic evidence that we have come together as a family.</p>
<p>So, what have I learned about myself this semester?  What are my own conclusions? This heretofore <a href="/posts/01/living-standards.html" title="Living Standards">unpublished entry</a> written in Cambodia sheds a bit of light on the recurrent theme of living simply.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion number one:</strong>  I can live a more simple lifestyle and live &ldquo;in the moment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>As I read over my early posts, and remember back to the end of January when we first arrived on Malta, I am going to admit that the following thought crossed my mind:  Leave this flat NOW, and check-in to the Meridien until it is time to fly home (business class).  I am very glad that I did not do that.  Living in the cold, damp, drafty, loud, and then warm, humid,  dusty, loud, almost-but-not-quite-a-place-I-call-home has been an important experience.  Now that the end is in sight, I am glad that I had the experience of these last four months.</p>
<p>The elves at Amazon.com must be worried about me, as I haven&rsquo;t ordered anything from them since December!  I have lived with the same ten shirts and six pairs of pants for the same period.  Other than going out to eat the material expenditures we have made so far this year are extremely minimal.  OK, I am not totally reformed as I have a new Apple Watch waiting for me back home.  But it was a good experience for me to not consume for a while.  Hopefully this will carry over back home where the temptation of Amazon Prime second day delivery makes the accumulation of stuff all too easy.</p>
<p>What does it mean to &ldquo;live in the moment?&rdquo;  For me it means accepting life as it happens.  It means taking the time to enjoy each moment as it comes along, rather than always thinking about what is coming next.   Because I have not had daily class responsibilities, I really have been able to live in the moment for most of the last four months.   OK, I am still a worrier; I am always thinking about the worst case scenario, and what to do if said scenario becomes reality.  I am a planner, and a goal setter, I am always thinking about next week, next month, When will my next exam be?  What do I need to do for class next week?  But this semester I haven&rsquo;t really had any of that to think about.  I did worry about some parts of our travel (Morocco, Istanbul&hellip;)  But, our evening meals were typically planned at about 15:00 when I walked to Meats and Eats to buy whatever we were going to make for dinner.</p>
<p>My time during the day was spent walking back and forth to the University.  I have subscribed to several podcasts and am now a regular listener to them.  I&rsquo;ve never had time for podcasts before.  I don&rsquo;t know why.   I spent time in class, listening and soaking up lectures on Maltese history and current issues.  I spent time in our flat, and in my office at the IT Faculty building sending countless organizational emails and working on projects and hacking.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion number two:</strong>  Follow your passion.</p>
<p>While this may not be a discovery of the semester, it was certainly a strong affirmation of this oft espoused philosophy.  I like to tell the students in Senior Project that: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t wake up in the morning thinking about what you want to accomplish during the day, you ought to be thinking about finding a new job.&rdquo;  Now, showers aside, I think that every day in Malta I did wake up and have a great excitement about what I wanted to accomplish during the day.  Some days it was the excitement of a field trip, other days it was waking up in Morocco or Istanbul know that a day of discovery was in store, but even on the rainy days of February I had research and thinking to do that was very exciting.</p>
<p>In fact maybe one of the best things about our time on the island was that it gave me <strong>time to think.</strong>  I spend a lot of time doing back home, and it is hard to carve out time to really step back and rethink things.  Good things happen when you take the time to think instead of do.  I feel like all of the projects I have been working on <a href="http://skulpt.org" title="Skulpt">Skulpt</a>, <a href="http://runestoneinteractive.org" title="Runestone">Runestone Interactive</a>, and the classes I will teach next semester have reaped the benefit of taking time to think.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion number three:</strong>  Push yourself outside of your comfort zone, good things will happen.</p>
<p>I have written a lot about pushing myself beyond my comfort zone in the last six months, but it has been very exciting to see the students do likewise.  They have all grown this semester, becoming more self confident, more self reliant, and maybe more willing to take a risk.  Whether that be jumping off a rock into the Mediterranean, or immersing themselves in other cultures.  For me it may have been simply embracing my part-time role as a student of history and current issues of Malta this semester that pushed me to a new appreciation of history and culture.  It was also surely the experience of living in a flat that is much less luxurious than back home.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion number four:</strong>  Be thankful for the people who support you.</p>
<p>Jane and I joke that we are excited to get back home so that we have more adults to talk to.  Not that our students are not adults, but we don&rsquo;t have the same conversations with twenty two year olds as we do with our fifty year old friends.  In some ways this has been a bit of an isolating experience for the two of us.  But we have grown used to it.  The silences are OK, as we know we simply don&rsquo;t have anything else to say at the moment.</p>
<p>But, through it all Jane has been a fantastic partner in keeping this program working smoothly.  The work she has put in on our travel plans is, extremely detailed, thorough and time consuming.  Planning a trip takes patience and hours of research.  I know I appreciate it and so do the students. It always amazes me when we arrive somewhere and she knows exactly where to go and which direction to turn, while my head is swirling in confusion.  My advice to Ethan and Ben is to follow my lead and &ldquo;marry above your station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I would also like to take this opportunity to publicly thank Corby Preus and Jon Lund in the Center for Global Learning back at Luther for all of their support.  Corby does an amazing job of helping with paperwork, and re-answering my questions about pretty much everything she has already explained to me at least once, and sometimes twice.</p>
<p>Here in Malta I would like to thank Dr. Emanuel Buttigieg for coordinating the History of Malta course, I know I have learned a lot this semester, and it takes a lot of coordination to organize all of the lecturers from many different departments on campus.  And finally to Rachelle Mifsud for whom there is no request too large or too small for her to help out with.  Scheduling transportation at the last minute, or helping with final exam schedules.  Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion number five:</strong>  Focus on the good</p>
<p>I think this is a nice one to save for last, and it is a fairly recent conclusion, and clearly one that will take some practice for me.  The last Paideia lecture we did an exercise where we had to think about Malta from the perspective of each of our five senses.  What stands out:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>sight &ndash; yellow limestone buildings, dog poop on the sidewalk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sound &ndash; honking horns, the &ldquo;angry&rdquo; maltese language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>smell &ndash; Pizza and the salt air</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>taste &ndash; Maltese wine, Wild Boar Pasta</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>touch &ndash; rough limestone, and cold tile</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of us commented after class about how negative most of the things we came up with sounded.  Even though the native Maltese professor came up with his own similar list.  Familiarity breeds contempt as the saying goes?</p>
<p>But I think the important lesson was summed up by a couple of the students in their own final blog posts in which they said.  &ldquo;I do not want to remember Malta for the dog poop on the sidewalks or the horns honking outside my bedroom window&rdquo;  Rather they , and I, will choose to remember Malta for the good stuff: The crystal clear water, the blue waters of the Blue Lagoon, St. Peter&rsquo;s Pool and Golden Bay, the majestic cliffs of Gozo as viewed from the Ocean or the cliffs of Dingli from the land.  The Neolithic temples of Hagar Qim and the mysterious Hypogeum.  The beauty of the Auzure Window.  The brightly colored Maltese boats in Spinola bay.  And, yes, the ever present yellow limestone of Sliema and Valletta. This is the way to remember Malta.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t sweat the small stuff my dad used to tell me.  Let the unpleasant annoying pet peeves fade away.</p>
<h2 id="not-goodbye">Not Goodbye</h2>
<p>Although this will be my final post from Malta, this is not the end of the blog.  In less than a week, the students will be on their way either home or to european travel for part of the summer.  Meanwhile Jane and I will be finishing up our own Mediterranean experience with a few days in Lake Como and then a Cruise from Venice down the Dalmatian Coast and through the Greek Isles, ending in Istanbul.  We planned this as a celebration of the end of our time in Malta, and I&rsquo;m sure it will be, but right now we are both facing this last part of the journey with mixed emotions.  The call of home is very strong, and I know that if we simply boarded a plane to Minneapolis we would be ecstatic.  But the comfort zone of home will have to wait another twenty days.  Its really not all that much when you consider we have been gone 159 days already, and more adventure awaits us, you can be sure I&rsquo;ll continue to write about it here.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>The first thing I should say about cooking in Malta is that there are around 600 reasons not to cook within walking distance.  Some of our favorites are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Guzé — OK, I <strong>love</strong> Pappardelle with wild boar sauce.  I could eat this once a week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pepperoncino — The Rosettes (little bowls of pappardelle and proscuitto cooked in cream sauce) are to die for.  Plus a totally small town friendly vibe that you just can’t beat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Piccolo Padre   &ndash; Eat pizza right out over the water.  Diavola yum!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wigi’s Kitchen — You can pick your fish or your steak right at the table.  The window seats have an awesome view of Balluta bay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kebabji. &ndash; The students introduced us to this one.  I think of it as &ldquo;the chipotle of Sliema.&rdquo;  My favorite is Chicken-shish with Tabbouleh, Hummus, Couscous, Harissa, and Sesame sauce.   Actually its the only thing on the menu I&rsquo;ve ever ordered, but why mess up a good thing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m going to divide the rest of this post into three parts, that roughly describe the three stages of cooking I have gone through here.  I call them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Subsistence cooking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting over it, and getting on with it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grilling season arrives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="subsistence-cooking">Subsistence cooking</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So, I admit when we first got here, I went through a bit of culture shock.  As I’ve mentioned before, it was colder inside our flat than it was outside, and it was rainy, and dreary most of the time.  Our kitchen was, and still is, tiny and isolated from the rest of the flat.  The cutlery was dull, and the pots and pans old and dented.  We must have set aside 50 knives and a dozen pots and pans from the three flats to be disposed of.</p>
<p>We made our first trip to a grocery store called Lidl, a german chain.  All of the ingredients were labelled in anything other than language.  There was little produce or fresh meat, and it was nowhere near our flat.  Next door to us is a small corner market, at the cash register is a young boy who ought to be in school but never is.  They have produce outside, but no fresh meat, and a totally random selection of dry goods.  There is a large supermarket about 1km away, and it has a lot of things.  Going to the Park Towers supermarket for the first time was like an adventure.  Taco shells!  A butcher, a cheese counter with Parmeggiano Reggiano, hot sauce, spices, asian ingredients.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first meal we cooked in the flat was a grilled cheese and ham sandwich.  Not regular ham but delicious prosciutto ham, and tomato soup.  Sound familiar?  I’ll bet that is the first thing that many people learn to cook.  I’ll bet it was two weeks before we cooked an evening meal in the flat.  In part because going out for dinner meant that we had some place warm and heated where we could go for a few hours before coming home and huddling under our covers.  The first true good meal I cooked was this pesto with chicken.  We quickly discovered that we don&rsquo;t care too much for pesto in a jar even this close to Italy.   We also learned that vegetables and fruits are much more seasonal here in Malta than in America.  So we had to wait a few weeks before basil came into season to make a good home made pesto.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="getting-over-it-getting-on-with-it">Getting over it, Getting on with it</h2>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Eventually, the temperature warmed up and we got more comfortable with our surroundings and we reached the point where we could not stand to eat out anymore and so we started cooking in the flat more.  One of my goals was to learn at least one new recipe while we were in Malta. I figured it would be so me kind of seafood, but it turns out the Maltese don&rsquo;t really eat that much seafood despite living on an island. After our trip to Rome I realized that what I really wanted to cook was spaghetti carbonara. For some reason I have missed out on this delicious yet simple dish my entire life.   This is one of those simple yet delicious Italian dishes.  Eggs, wine, noodles, cheese, and good cured ham or bacon.  I have been making steady progress on mastering this dish, but I still have a ways to go before it will live up to that first night in Rome.</p>
<p>The second thing that made a turnaround in our cooking was learning to shop.  Now there are four places that are worth highlighting.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>O&rsquo;Ryan&rsquo;s on the corner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The college street mini market (the green market)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>park towers supermarket</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meats and Eats on Dingli</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all the vegetable trucks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dispatch with Park Towers first.  Big, indifferent to rude staff, distant.  Shopped there a couple of times and decided not to go back.  Jane has been back a couple of times to stock up on cleaning and bathroom supplies, but we don&rsquo;t shop there anymore for groceries.</p>
<p>The corner store is great for water, limoncello, Pringles, and the occasional need for baguette and salami.  It&rsquo;s about double the size of my living room, but packs in all of the essentials including frozen meats.  The owner and his family run it together. Nine times out of ten when you go in there you would think that the mother is on the verge of killing the father or the son. Or it might just be that most Arabic conversations still sound like arguments to my western ears.  Much of the time the cash register is &ldquo;manned&rdquo; by a boy who clearly should be in school but is not.  I suppose he will inherit the store and so is learning the trade and the family does not feel the need to send him to school.</p>
<p>The green market is much larger than the corner store, and has great fresh baked bread every day.  They have a reasonable selection of fruits and vegetables out front, along with canned goods and other essentials.  Most of the time the cash register is manned by an old man who has never once rung up an entire order correctly, but he is charming and friendly every time we go to the store.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Meats and Eats is probably the single best thing that happened to my cooking during our stay in Malta. The store is bright and clean and staffed by a bunch of friendly Italians.  The meat counter is a joy to visit almost every day.  It&rsquo;s the kind of meat counter wher they have several big hunks of ribeye, originating from around the world, and they Will cut you off a hunk of whatever thickness you like.  They also have marinated pork and chicken and fresh minced beef and pork.  The rest of the store has great gourmet ingredients as well as some nice convince items like prepared curry sauce.  The cheese counter has huge chunks of parmigiana reggiano at a ridiculously low price.  Next to the checkout counter is a wine selection that is just about as good as anything you can find in Malta.</p>
<p>I knew that I was going to have a great time shopping at Meats and Eats the morning I decided to give carbonara a try.  I went to the meat counter to get some bacon and had the following conversation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clint:  Sorry sir, we only have streaky bacon today.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me: Uhhhhm streaky bacon?  <em>Ahh, the stuff that just looks like regular bacon to my eye.</em>  What&rsquo;s the difference?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Clint:   Very thin, not the good cured pork belly.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Me:  Oh,  well I&rsquo;m just experimenting with carbonara sauce so I think the streaky bacon will work.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Clint:  Oh no sir, you should not do that. If you are doing carbonara you need the good bacon or one of the packages of pancetta in the case over there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh yes, agreed the lady standing next to me at the counter.   Now I am left wondering how I will find this wonderful chunky pancetta back home.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another thing I&rsquo;m excited about continuing back home is fried spring rolls!  Jane and I had lessons on making these in Vietnam,  and were excited to try our hand on our own.  When I discovered an Asian market on my walk to school I knew this would become a reality in Malta.  Shopping in the Asian market is like Christmas, I see all of these cool exotic ingredients and I want to get them and try them out.  Fresh lemon grass, six different kinds of fish sauce, Hoisin, Sirachi, you name it.  Now the key to good spring rolls in my opinion starts with the wrapper, and I definitely like the frozen wrappers much better than the dried.  They are easier to work with and I like the texture of the end product better.  With a little more practice I&rsquo;ll be ready to challenge my friend Nancy to a Spring Roll Throwdown!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A Sunday morning expedition to the Marsaxlokk  (Mar-sa-shlock) fish market provided an opportunity to learn how to fillet and cook fresh caught sea bass.  There are many other types of fish available at the market as well, but Jane and I had both watched a you-tube video on filleting sea bass, so that was the direction we went.  The market also has huge king prawns, but taking the head and legs off the prawns is a lot of work for my lunch.  One thing that amazed me about the fish market was that it was not the least bit fishy smelling.  In fact other than the fish market in the middle of Gzira I have yet to walk along the sea here in Malta and think, oh fishy, or ocean.  I guess it goes with the crystal clear water.</p>
<p>One thing that we have really had to work on is finding variety in our diet.  Back home we enjoy the cuisine of many different countries all in the same week.  Tex-Mex one night, grilling the next, indian or Thai curry after that, italian, vietnamese, pot roast in the crock pot (an American Tagine),  you name it, we like our variety.  Making tacos is definitely a comfort food that we miss.  The ingredients are just about impossible to find.  Sour Cream and creme fresh are not the same,  The salsa here on the isaland is just not up to par.  Finding taco shells is possible at the Park Towers supermarket, but you have to go there to buy them.  Then there is the beef, or what the British and Maltese call <em>mince</em>  I suppose that if you look at it objectively <em>mince</em> is no worse of a word than <em>ground</em> but having grown up with ground beef,  minced beef sounds a little disgusting to my ears.</p>
<p>The other odd thing is the lack of soups.  You simply cannot buy <strong>cream of mushroom</strong> anywhere!  So we have gone six months without one of the staple comfort dishes of my entire life, namely beef stroganhoff.  The availability of wonderful Parmiagianno Reggiano makes risotto a good comfort fill in, and here we run into the lack of chicken stock.  I suppose I could, and should, make my own stock but that takes advanced planning.  I&rsquo;m used to just grabbing a carton of stock from the coop to make my risotto.  Here it appears that boiled water with bullion cubes, or a little container of gelatinous chicken stock substance that you disolve in water takes the place of a good stock.  It does the trick, especially with a little extra Reggiano.</p>
<p>And finally a word about wine.  Maltese wine is surprisingly good, and incredibly cheap.  While many of the students pride themselves on keeping it under 3 euros a bottle, I have found many good wines for under ten.  My favorites are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ISIS, a rather unfortunate name for a wine in this day and age, but it really is my favorite</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maltese Falcon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marsamena &ndash; a delicious chardonnay from Gozo</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On the subject of wine I would be totally remiss if I did not mention our local wine shop.  Owned and run by a young man from the south of France, Vini Culture is a fun place to stop in on my way home from school, or to just run  around the corner and grab a bottle for happy hour.  The young guy who runs the store is extremely friendly and pleasant.  I never stop in there without having an enjoyable conversation about wine and France and all the new things he has on order for us to try.  Its hard to understand how he makes a living in a specialty shop like that in the middle of Sliema but I&rsquo;m happy I got to know him and shop there.</p>
<h2 id="grilling-season">Grilling season</h2>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And suddenly grilling season was upon us.   The roof was a much sunnier and less windy place.  The sun was starting to stay out until a reasonable cooking hour.  Meats and Eats has a wonderful pork steak marinated in mediterranean spices, and we can grill that and serve it with some roasted new potatoes from my Sicilian vegetable man.  Some fresh baked bread, and some spinach salad with strawberries and vinaigrette dressing.</p>
<p>The Sicilian vegetable guy, I have no idea what his name is, is another great story.  Since meats and eats does not sell vegetables, I just walk another half block to this guys fresh vegetable truck.  I know he thinks I&rsquo;m kind of odd because I usually come in and buy one hot pepper, six small potatoes, or one head of garlic, depending on what I need for the evening meal.  Its not usually much, and it almost always under one euro.</p>
<p>One day I was buying a pepper and an onion for a total of 40 cents, I had forgotten to put change in my pocket before I left the flat.  As I struggled to find some coins and then started to pull out my wallet for a bill he said &ldquo;listen, don&rsquo;t worry, you can pay me tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grilling season brought with it much more than an opportunity to stand on the roof and cook meat with a drink in my hand.  It brought a huge transformation in the weather, and consequently my enjoyment of our time in Malta.  No longer did I get out of bed in the morning and wrap myself in multiple layers of clothing, no longer were we huddled in the front room, door closed, heater running in order to feel comfortable.</p>
<p>I miss my Hasty Bake, and its ability to cook and smoke meat slowly, but this little gas powered grill has brought a lot of enjoyment.  Meats and Eats sells Kobe beef patties, as well as Ribeye steak from five different countries, including Australia and Ireland.  It has been fun to try the variety.  They have chicken marinated in three or four different marinades an so that provides us with a great variety of things to try.</p>
<p>It is certainly true that you can learn a lot about a culture by its food.  Malta is definitely no different.  The Italian influence is obvious in the pizza and pasta restaurants that are everywhere.  Their national dish of Pastizzi is not my favorite, but has certainly become a cheap lunchtime staple for many of the students.    The traditional Maltese foods include rabbit, which is also quite good &ndash; especially the rabbit pie at Guze &ndash; and some other stuffed meat dishes.  There are turkish kebab and pizza places everywhere.  We think its an odd combination, and we wonder about all the kebab joints.  I think it must have to do with the influence of the Ottoman empire on the island long ago, but I may be completely wrong.  In general, it is a diet high in carbohydrates, which works for me, but drives Jane crazy.   Jane and I had one of those funny conversations back in January, where the question was if you had to give up variety, and live with one cuisine, which would it be?  Both of us chose Itialian or Vietnamese as our top two.  Then I was leaning toward Italian, but now I am looking forward to more of the fresh healthy variety offered by the Vietnamese.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <ul>
<li>
<p>I want people to be able to write and host the static parts of any book on any server.  You can think of each page in a book as its own single page application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to provide back-end services so that students using any book hosted anywhere can save their programs and answers to quizzes etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to continue to gather research data on how students learn computer science.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to make the registration and login process as easy as possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the static parts can be hosted anywhere (including a site like <a href="interactivepython.org">interactivepython.org</a>)  The interactive parts are going to involve making cross-domain XMLHttpRequests (xhr).  Of course the first thing that happens when you have a page hosted on <code>static-site</code> that makes an xhr request to <code>ajax-server</code> is that you get an error.   Browsers and sites work together to disallow cross-domain requests to prevent a variety of nasty behaviors.  But, there are many times (wlike now) when you have a legitimate reason for doing this.  So, the w3c created the Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) standard to help developers get around this.  Cory Dolphin has created an excellent plugin for <a href="flask.pocoo.org">Flask</a> developers called <a href="http://github.com/corydolphin/flask-cors">Flask-CORS</a>.  The plugin is a great example of the brilliant design behind Flask and in fact the entire WSGI stack.</p>
<h2 id="the-really-simple-approach">The Really Simple Approach</h2>
<p>The first thing you find when you start googling about this problem is that there is a seemingly simple solution.  If you have control over your AJAX response you simply need to add an HTTP header <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>  problem solved.  Now everyone in the world can make xhr requests to your server and use the results in their page.</p>
<p>Adding a header is pretty simple in Flask.  All you need to do is use <code>response.headers.add(&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot;, &quot;*&quot;</code>   Problem solved, moving right along to the next programming challenge.</p>
<p>Or maybe not.   Minutes later you realize that this is not all that great because you have decorated some of your requests to require a login.  That wont be a problem if the static page is served from the same domain because you will automatically get the session cookie, and the Flask-Security extension will eat that cooking and validate things for you.  BUT if your static page is not served from the same domain you will not even get the session cookie.  Oh Bother.  But you also have a second problem.  You have probably violated the CORS specification without even meaning to.  Really, if I had to read the spec for every web standard I wanted to use I would seriously think about changing careers.  But, <strong>here is the important part</strong> you may not return a CORS header unless the request contains an origin header!  Chances are you tested you change with a quick <code>curl</code> call to your endpoint, saw the Access-Control header and were happy.  But you sure didn’t give it an origin header on the request when you did that.  So to summarize, we have two problems we need to solve:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We want to incorporate authentication into our cross origin strategy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We want to be good citizens and follow the spec.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-smart-approach">The Smart Approach</h2>
<p>The smart approach is to use a nice extension where <em>other</em> people have figured this out, and presumably followed the specification. Enter Flask-CORS.  You can enable CORS support with a simple decorator <code>@cross_origin</code>  This will automatically add the  <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code> to responses.  <strong>As long as your test request includes an Origin</strong>.  If you are like me you will forget that part, and then wonder why the extension must not be working.  So this solves problem 2.</p>
<p>To solve problem 1 here is a snippet of code that works just fine.</p>
<pre><code>@ajax.route('/ajax/page')

@login_required

@cross_origin(supports_credentials=True)

def test():

    return jsonify({'foo':'bar'})
</code></pre>
<p>The above responds to the url <code>/ajax/page</code>  I have all of my API calls in an <code>ajax</code> blueprint with ajax as part of the url.  I’m requiring that the user is logged in before I allow them to access this endpoint.  I also want it to be allowed cross origin.  This is where the parameter to the <code>@cross_origin</code> comes into play.  Supports credentials sets up the CORS response to return an additional CORS header:  <code>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:  &quot;true&quot;</code>.  For one final twist, you need to know that when you have <code>supports_credentials=True</code> you may NOT set <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>  You need to be specific and set the origin to the origin that comes in the request headers.  To Make this work and try it out from the client side, here is a bit of HTML/Javascript.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;button onclick=&quot;corsTest();&quot;&gt;TestCORS&lt;/button&gt;



&lt;script&gt;

    function corsTest() {

        var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

        xhr.withCredentials = true;

        xhr.onload = function () {

            alert(xhr.responseText);

        }

        xhr.onerror = function () {

            alert(&quot;error&quot;);

        }



        xhr.open(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;http://example.com/ajax/page&quot;, true)

        xhr.send()

    }

&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Note that you need to set <code>xhr.withCredentials</code> in order for your session cookie to be sent along.  By default cookies are NOT sent with cross origin requests.</p>
<p>Now, I may end up adding more to this as I discover the intricacies of so called “Non-Simple” requests.  That is requests beyond simple GET and POST, as I work on moving my API toward a RESTful API which uses PUT and others.  This will nodoubt enlighten me about preflighted requests.  Which I can only assume means something different than sitting around in an airport bar waiting for your flight to be called.</p>

<h1 id="morning-climb-to-castelmola">Morning Climb to Castelmola</h1>
<p>Since the students were planning on sleeping in this morning, Jane and I decided to explore on our own a bit.  High above Taormina sits the little town of Castelmola.  You can&rsquo;t drive there, you have to climb.  And so we did.  But when we arrived in the little town we were rewarded with a spectacular view up and down the Ionian coast.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After enjoying the view we decided that a Cannoli and Cafe were in order before we started the hike down.  At the end of one small street we found the perfect place.  Maria, the proprietor of Gallo Cedro was cutting tomatoes on the terrace.  &ldquo;Prego,&rdquo; she said by way of invitation to come in and sit down.  The Cannoli&rsquo;s were first rate.  She stuffed them fresh for us and added some chocolate chips and pistachios to top off each end.  Perfecto.  We were about half done with the Cannolis when she unexpectedly appeared with two shot glasses and a bottle of almond wine.  Well it was only 10AM, but we figured when in Sicily&hellip;  So we had a little digestif to help the cannolis go down.</p>
<h1 id="gole-alcantara">Gole Alcantara</h1>
<p>We returned to the Lemon Tree (the name of our apartments) around 11 and everyone was out of bed and getting themselves awake for the day.  We had some discussion about what we might do this afternoon.  The gorge, known as Gole Alcantara, sounded like an interesting short hike and there was enthusiasm among the group for a stop at a Sicilian winery.</p>
<p>We made our way to Gole Alcantara and after making a donation to the parking attendant we set out on our short walk down to the gorge.  It was beautiful.  Of course many of our &ldquo;kids&rdquo; wanted nothing more than to play in the water which was quite a problem  since we had not brought beach towels or anything for them to dry off with.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As we enjoyed the area, we checked our email to see if we would be able to visit any of the wineries.  Unfortunately none of them could accommodate us that afternoon.  So&hellip;  We decided that we could do our own wine tasting back at the Lemon Tree.</p>
<h1 id="red-and-white">Red and White</h1>
<p>The wine tasting preparation required another stop at the supermarket where we put a strict limit on the price of wine to be purchased for the tasting. Our goal was to keep it under 100 euros while recognizing that with 13 people each of us would just get a taste of each different bottle.  It was quite the production to get six of us to agree on what wine to select.  I will say that the Italian construction workers who were supposed to be building another set of shelves in the middle of the aisle we fairly amused/distracted by the blonde haired blue eyed wine aficionados.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>While we were in the wine aisle another group was in charge of meat and cheese and fruit.  As you can see we put out a pretty good spread.  We also agreed that we were &ldquo;in for the night&rdquo; as there was no way we were going to drive our mini-vans down or up the winding hill to the Lemon Tree after wine tasting activities.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The wine and cheese went remarkably quickly.  Even with a seventh inning swimming stretch between the reds and the whites.   I guess it was inevitable that after a bit of wine, some of the people were going to end up in the pool fully clothed.</p>
<p>With the reds, gone, people were in the mood for movies or whatever, and then &ldquo;the munchies&rdquo; set in.  We had been told that there was at least one Pizzeria that would deliver all the way up the hill, and that Paula would take care of calling and ordering for us.  After much trying however it was determined that the pizza places were closed on Monday night.  The horror and sorrow of a hungry group of students without pizza.  We were totally resigned to a pizza free night when Paula knocked on our door to inform me that the pizzas had arrived!  We were saved.  And for some reason she was convinced that the students needed a nightcap, and so brought them a complementary bottle of home made limoncello!</p>

			 <p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The van arrived right on schedule, 4:45 AM, and we were all in the courtyard in front of the flat on Triq  DePiro ready to go.  This is our last group trip together with the Malta students, Spring 2015 edition.  It is a bonus trip in the sense that because Jane saved us a bunch of money by doing so much planning for our trips to Rome, Morocco, and Istanbul,  that we were able to afford the plane tickets and lodging to get everyone to Sicily.  Of course with budget travel comes early morning flights, but nobdy seemed to mind very much.  We were, after all, heading for Sicily.  What nobody guessed was that we have a distinctly non-budget view from our lodgings for the next three nights!</p>
<p>The flight to Catania is ridiculously short is is just over 100 miles and takes less than 30 minutes, we barely got above 11,000 feet before we started our descent.  Our departure time was so early that once we arrived in Catania we had a good hour to wait before the rental car agencies opened up.  Yes, we are driving in Sicily.  Its part of the plan to keep costs low for this trip.  Two mini vans for the group.  The plan for the day was to meander our way north to Taormina stopping along the way at Bronte to sample some Pistachios and at Randazzo to check out lava as a building material in a Medieval town.</p>
<p>The highlight of the day was to do some hiking on Mount Etna.  It is amazing that there is still snow on the volcano in mid-May and even more so when you consider that the volcano is <a href="http://rt.com/news/228691-etna-lava-eruption-volcano">quite active</a> right now.</p>
<p>We started out together as a group and enjoyed the break from the busy urban vibe of our home in Sliema, stopping for a group photo in this cool clump of trees:</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6ca594f8d5.jpg" alt="group"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Eventually the group splintered with varying degrees of adventurousness, and an unfortunate bruised thigh for Jane due to a loose rock.  Some of us persevered up the side of the volcano until the winds became so strong we thought we would blow away.  Climbing through the lava is a lot like climbing up a giant sand dune.  It is very hard work.  It also reminded us of the scenes of Frodo and Sam climbing into Mordor in Return of the King.  As we were scrambling our way up, a helicopter flew overhead and hovered over us for a few minutes.  I think we all expected to hear a loud voice tell us to turn around and get out of there, but I guess they decided we were harmless and not in harms way as it soon moved on.  After we reached our goal we were tired and happy to be there if only for a few minutes to enjoy the view.</p>

<p>As we began to descend our shoes soon became filled with sharp little pieces of lava.  This made the descent quite painful and necessitated a few stops to empty the shoes.  At one point I was really glad Emma was standing behind me as she remarked.  &ldquo;I wonder who&rsquo;s glasses these are?&rdquo;  Of course they were mine having just fallen out of my pocket as I was emptying my shoes.  That would have been a loss, and impossible to find one pair of transition lenses hiding in miles of black rock.</p>

			 <p>Every day is a good day when you are on a boat, in the beautiful blue Mediterranean.  After a bit of a mixup on the bus this morning, we got to spend 4 amazing hours with Captain Franz on a boat trip from St. Paul’s bay to Gozo to Comino.  Complete with caves, and cliffs, and swimming.  Click on the thumbnail below to see the photo gallery for today.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The bus mixup is amusing now that I look at it a day later…  We had arranged for van to pick us up at 9:00 to bring us up to St. Paul’s bay.  But after waiting and waiting I finally connected with my contact, Rachelle, at the University who handles all our transportation scheduling for us.  It turned out the bus company had screwed up the schedule for the day.  The solution was to send a coach. The only other vehicle available and in the area. No, not one with horses, a giant bus.  Wait by the corner we were told.  Oooops  wrong corner.  More delay.  Imagine the 14 of us on a coach that could easily hold 60 people.    So we made it to St. Paul’s in Style and in the end were only about 35 minutes late. Thankfully Frans was a very patient captain, and it was no problem  to extend our time in the afternoon to make up for our lateness.</p>

			 <p>As part of the grand reorganization of the various tools and software associated with the <a href="http://runestoneinteractive.org">Runestone Interactive</a> project I am planning to also write a series of tutorials to help people get started.  The major aspects of this reorganization are discussed in detail in the <a href="https://github.com/bnmnetp/runestone/wiki/DevelopmentRoadmap">Project Roadmap</a>, but for the sake of some context I can summarize the major efforts as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Separate the distribution and development of writing tools from the server.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make a pip installable runestone package.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the interconnectedness between the components and Sphinx.  In other words support the user of runestone tools in environments like Markdown, and even wysiwyg html editors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Re-architect the server side focusing on services for the writing tools</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create an authentication service that supports CORS for cross domain AJAX use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a standard REST API for logging and storing student data</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a web application (or integrate with another) for grading</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since I just completed Part 1.1 I thought it was a good time to talk about how easy it is for you to now use the runestone tools for creating a lab for your students, or lecture notes and presentation materials for your class.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>The major steps in getting started are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Installing Python</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installing the runestone tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Building your first lab</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="install-python">Install Python</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If you are on a Mac you are already done with this step.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are on Windows you will need to go to <a href="http://python.org">Python.org</a> and download Python3.x.   The windows installer is a typical installer and you can just click your way through it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are an advanced Python user you may want to may want to create a <code>virtualenvironment</code> for this project but it is not a requirement.</p>
<p>If you are on Windows you may want to edit your PATH environment variable following the instructions <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/using/windows.html">here</a>.  Again, mac users can ignore this.</p>
<h3 id="installing-the-runestone-components">Installing the Runestone Components</h3>
<p>You are going to need to use the command line for the rest of this tutorial, so start up a <a href="http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line">Terminal</a>   (/Applications/Utilities on a Mac  or run <a href="http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/faq/id-1656450/windows-powershell-feature.html">PowerShell</a> or cmd.exe on Windows)  I will repeat myself here.  These commands need to be run from the command line, <strong>not</strong> from the Python shell.</p>
<p>Run the <code>pip</code> command</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install runestone
</code></pre>
<p>Or on Windows if you have not modified  your PATH try:</p>
<pre><code>C:\\Python34\Scripts\pip.exe install runestone
</code></pre>
<p>From now on I&rsquo;m only going to give the Mac way of running the commands.  If you are on windows you will need to add <code>C:\\Python34\Scripts</code> to the beginning of the command and add <code>.exe</code> to the end.</p>
<p>You can watch as a lot of text goes scrolling by.  But as long as you don&rsquo;t get any errors you should be good to go.  You only need to do these first two steps once.  Once you have installed Python and runestone you will not have to do it again.</p>
<h3 id="starting-your-first-runestone-project">Starting your first Runestone Project</h3>
<p>Here is a session of me on my computer creating a simple project.</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir mynewproject

$ cd mynewproject

$ runestone init



This will create a new Runestone project in your current directory.

Do you want to proceed?  [Y/n]: y

Next we need to gather a few pieces of information to create your configuration files

Project name: (one word, no spaces): myhello

path to build dir  [./build]:

require login   [false]:

URL for ajax server  [http://127.0.0.1:8000]:

Your Name  [bmiller]: Brad Miller

Title for this project  [Runestone Default]: My Hello World

Log student actions?  [True]: False

Done.  Type runestone build to build your project
</code></pre>
<p>At this point you will have the following files and folders:</p>
<pre><code>mynewproject/

        _static/

        _sources    

        _templates  

        conf.py

        pavement.py
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>_static</code> folder is for things like images or javscript files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>_sources</code> folder is where you will put your own writing.  To start with there are a couple of examples files for you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>_templates</code> folder is for styling.  There is a default set of templates that match the runestone interactive look and feel.  That is a good thing to start with.  Once you become more familiar with the system you may want to customize the templates or even make your own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>conf.py</code> file is used by Sphinx, and contains information from some of the questions you answered when you initialized your project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>pavement.py</code> file is used for building and setting build parameters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these files are important, and you should not delete any of them.</p>
<p>Next run <code>runestone build</code>  This command will create a build/mynewproject folder with an index.html file in it.  If you want you can now run <code>runestone serve</code> and then go to your browser and open up the following URL  <code>http://localhost:8000/index.html</code>   Yay!  You have a webpage.  Feel free to explore a bit to get an idea about some of the components you can use in your lab.</p>
<h3 id="writing-your-own-lab">Writing your Own Lab</h3>
<p>OK, lets edit  <code>_sources/index.rst</code>   Initially it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>=====================

This Is A New Project

=====================





SECTION 1: Introduction

:::::::::::::::::::::::



Congratulations!   If you can see this file you have probably successfully run the ``runestone init`` command.  If you are looking at this as a source file you should now run ``runestone build``  to generate html files.   Once you have run the build command you can run ``runestone serve`` and then view this in your browser at ``http://localhost:8000``



This is just a sample of what you can do.  The index.rst file is the table of contents for your entire project.  You can put all of your writing in the index, or as you will see in the following section you can include additional rst files.  those files may even be in subdirectories that you can reference using a relative path.



The overview section, which follows is an ideal section to look at both online and at the source.  It is pretty easy to see how to write using any of the interactive features just by looking at the examples in ``overview.rst``





SECTION 2: An Overview of the extensions

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



.. toctree::

   :maxdepth: 2



   overview.rst





SECTION 2: Add more stuff here

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::



You can add more stuff here.
</code></pre>
<p>If you are not familiar with markup languages, this file should still be quite readable to you, and you can probably easily guess what most things do.  Runestone uses a markup language called restructuredText.  There is a very nice, short tutorial <a href="http://getnikola.com/quickstart.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of what you see in the example above,  the section that starts with <code>.. toctree::</code> is called a directive and it creates a table of contents for you.  the <code>maxdepth</code> part sets the table of contents to show sections and subsections.  And the line with <code>overview.rst</code> indicates that it is a file that should be included in the overall  web page.  More on all of this later. Our first task is simply going to be to wipe everything out, and start over.   Using a plain text editor change index.rst to look like this:</p>
<pre><code>=============

My Sample Lab

=============



Part 1: Turtle Graphics

=======================



In this section we will do the following:



* Create a turtle

* Make the turtle draw a box



.. activecode:: turtle1



   import turtle



   timmy = turtle.Turtle()

   for i in range(4):

       timmy.forward(100)

       timmy.right(90)





Now it is your turn.  Can you modify the program to make timmy draw an octagon instead of a square?
</code></pre>
<p>Now save the file and rerun the <code>runestone build</code> command.  Everything should build without a problem and you can now run <code>runestone serve</code> and open up <code>http://localhost:8000</code> from your browser.  Notice that you can change the program and rerun it right from your browser.</p>
<p>It is probably obvious that you can create headings and subheadings.  Unordered lists are created using <code>*</code> and the runnable code examples are created by the <code>.. activecode::</code>  directive. The name turtle1 must be unique on the webpage, other than that it is not used for too much at this point.  The rest of the activecode directive contains plain old python code, but it must be indented to line up with the <code>a</code> in <code>activecode.</code>  All indented lines are included as the body of the activecode directive, regular text processing starts at the first unindented line.</p>
<p>There you have it.  You have created a very nice little lesson without a lot of hassle.  The Runestone and Sphinx tools take care of all of the formatting for you!</p>
<h2 id="giving-students-browser-access-to-the-lab">Giving Students Browser Access to the Lab</h2>
<p>If you have your own webpage hosted on a school server that you normally use for class you can make your Lab available to the students by simply taking the folder <code>mynewproject</code> inside the <code>build</code> folder and putting that on your website.  The folder is self contained and can be hosted on any web server.</p>
<p>If you know the IP Address of your own computer and you simply want to give let students bring up the webpage from your computer you can do that too.  For example, lets suppose you know that your IP address is <code>10.0.0.23</code>  Your students can get everything they need from <code>http://10.0.0.23:8000/index.html</code></p>
<h3 id="coming-soon">Coming Soon</h3>
<p>There are many free web hosting solutions out there and you can also choose one of them and upload your project folder for hosting there.  I&rsquo;ll cover at least one of them in another tutorial.  In fact I think I see a whole series of tutorials in the future on topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Making an online quiz for class</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making a lecture or presentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hosting your lab or quiz on <strong>github pages</strong> or another online service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using your lab with runestone services</p>
</li>
</ul>

			 <h2 id="gastronomic-negotiation">Gastronomic Negotiation</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, you walk past me <strong>every night.</strong> Please give me a chance!  I will give you an appetizer and  free baklava for desert!&rdquo;  <em>Really?  I honestly don&rsquo;t remember you.  I&rsquo;ve only walked down this road one other time.</em>  &ldquo;Very Sorry&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already got a dinner reservation back at Ocean&rsquo;s 7. &quot;  &ldquo;you will like it!&rdquo; Says one of the patrons at the current establishment.  Another ten steps down the road and we are implored to &ldquo;Look at my menu.&rdquo;  A bit further on we are told  &ldquo;Sir, I have your table ready for you!&rdquo; The idea that you can bargain for your supper seems so counter productive to me that I just cannot fathom it.  Hey, lets see how little I can pay for something I&rsquo;m about to ingest into my body.  The incentives here are all in the wrong direction!</p>
<p>I can only imagine the conversations in the kitchen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Waiter:</em>   One chicken and rice for the cheapskates at table five!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chef:</em>  Oh great, now we know what to do with the gizzard and thigh meat that has been sitting on the floor all night!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>No Thank You</strong>  I will be more than happy to pay a price that puts the chef on my side.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Waiter:</em>  Chef the generous folks are back at table seven.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Chef:</em>  Great, tell them to order the veal, I&rsquo;ve got two extra tender pieces I&rsquo;ve been saving for my best customers.  Oh, and bring up that 2011 Rombaur Chardonnay from the cellar, I know they will love that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think we can all agree on which chef we would rather have cooking our food.</p>
<p>This whole hawking the restaurant thing has been an ongoing saga since we arrived in Istanbul, and we even experienced it in London a couple of weekends ago.  I don&rsquo;t remember it being the case in Vietnam or Morocco, and certainly not in Malta,  but maybe this has more to do with the onset of high touring season than our location.   Now, this is not really a scam  (although we have heard stories of the old bait and switch ) so much as an intro to  the two things that happened to us today.</p>
<h2 id="cruising-on-a-reputable-ferry">Cruising on a Reputable Ferry</h2>
<p>Our plan for the day was to take the Ferry up the Bosphorus river to the mouth of the Black Sea.  You get to see a lot of Istanbul along the way, then the ferry stops for a couple of hours so you can have lunch or do a little hiking and then comes back.  As usual Jane had it all planned out, including a discount for using our museum passes.  When we arrived at the waterfront we were immediately accosted by the usual crowd of tour people trying to sell us one of their packages.  &ndash; two hour boat trips, three hour boat trips, six hour boat trips&hellip;  &ldquo;No, we are going on the ferry!&rdquo; we would say.  &ldquo;But I can leave sooner.  I will take you to the same place, wait for two hours and bring you back.  My boat holds 80, it will be much nicer than the ferry and 800 people!&rdquo;  Hmmm, we were intrigued, and a bit horrified that we were even considering this option.  But after a bit of negotiation, and multiple confirmations about our destination and pricing we decided to risk it.  The captain even threw in a 50% discount on coffee at the nearby snack shack.  Run by a relative no doubt.  &ldquo;Just wait here&rdquo; we were told.  So we waited and watched them try to work their magic on other passersby.</p>
<p>After a while, one of them came up to talk to us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We cannot take you.  I cannot do the trip for just your group.  It will be better if you take the ferry, down there.  There are not enough passengers today, because the bike race is keeping them all away from here.  I am sorry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was true, there was a big Tour of Istanbul bike race in town, and the weather was a bit dreary, so the pier was sparsely populated.  Which also meant that the ferry was not nearly as crowded as Jane&rsquo;s research had led us to believe it would be.  So, we carried on with our original plan, got our tickets to the ferry and were on our way.</p>
<p>The cruise was interesting, we got to see some castles, and some amazing real estate.  And even a container ship that originated from Valletta!  We just can&rsquo;t get away from Malta now.  Here is a little slideshow of some photos on the tour.</p>

<h2 id="the-shoeshine-redemption">The shoeshine redemption</h2>
<p>After the cruise we had to make our way back into the spice market to buy some of the delicious candy covered &ldquo;fistik.&rdquo;  That is peanuts covered in a syrup and rolled in sesame seeds.  We discovered these our last day in Morocco, and were only too happy to find out you can buy them in Turkey as well.  Some of the group wanted to hit the archeological museum while others just wanted to wander the spice market some more.  So we turned them loose and decided to wander our own way back to the hotel.</p>
<p>As we were passing up one street that was very lightly travelled a shoe shine man dropped his brush in front of us.  So, we picked it up and called out to him to give it back.  He thanked us and we were on our way.  Suddenly he called back to us.  He sat down and and said &ldquo;please,&rdquo;  with a look that said let me repay your kindness.   We thought how nice, one good turn deserves another.  But I had on my hiking shoes, which are not &ldquo;shineable&rdquo; and so he offered to shine Jane&rsquo;s black shoes which were definitely in need of some love after all of our travels.  He finished up Jane&rsquo;s shoes and then insisted on brushing mine with a toothbrush and some water &ndash; which certainly did not hurt.  About this time both Jane and I reached into our pockets for a few coins to tip the guy.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise when Jane offered him several one lyra coins and he said &ldquo;no, paper&rdquo;  What?  He doesn&rsquo;t want coins he wants paper money?  Slowly it dawned on me that we had been played this whole time.  He now wanted to be paid the full amount for two shoe shines, which took less than a couple of minutes.  I added my coins to Jane&rsquo;s and dumped them in his hand and we turned and walked away.  I guess we both got half price shoe shines, and nine turkish lyra (about $3).  Lesson learned, and a small price to pay for a story to add to the blog.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;You want a fish!?&rdquo; Said the night watchman with confusion.  &ldquo;No,&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;do you have a cork-screw?&rdquo;  doing my best imitation of screwing in a corkscrew and then pulling out the cork.  &ldquo;Ah!  One moment&rdquo;  And off he went, out the front door and into the restaurant across the street.  Moments later he was back with an excellent corkscrew, which I used to uncork the bottle we had purchased around the corner and then returned to him.   After I got back to the room I could not contain my laughter any more.  A fish?  The fact that he borrowed the corkscrew from the restaurant, which was the very thing that Jane had suggested in the first place.  An idea that I soundly rejected.  Hi, I know that we didn&rsquo;t eat dinner here or buy anything from you but would you mind terribly if I borrowed your corkscrew to open the bottle of wine I bought at the market around the corner?   I just can&rsquo;t imagine myself saything those words.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  A glass of wine was a great way to cap off what had been a very full day of touring around the old city of Istanbul.  Once known as Constantinople, it was the head of the Christian world.  Then under the Ottoman empire it became a Muslim country.  Today, Turkey is largly muslim, but the government is a secular government.  We began with a tour of Topkapi Palace were we visited the treasury, and the Harem and saw the Sultans private rooms.  We also visited the tulip gardens.  It is an interesting fact that although Holland is usually celebrated for its tulips, the Dutch took them and transplated the tulips from Istanbul originally!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5d5a0cb583.jpg" alt="Tulips"></p>
<p>In the hall of mirrors, I told students about recursion.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>They did not care.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->  From the Palace we moved on to the Blue Mosque, one of the icons of Istanbul.  There was a really long line to get in, but we made the best of it, while Ben ran into someone with nearly the same last name as him in line.  He turned out to be from wisconsin, and has relatives in Decorah.  Small world.  The line was rather entertaining, as standing in line appears to be optional for many tourists here in Istanbul.  However all of the guides team up to try and send the line jumpers to the end.  It is interesting to see the reaction of the people who clearly know they are being jerks and getting called out for it.  Once we got inside it was amazing.  It is so hard to describe this space, like St. Peters in Rome it is just so large that you cannot hope to capture the scale of the whole thing.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Across a very large square from the Blue Mosque is Hagia Sofia.  This was once the largest Christian church in the world.  Of course it was later supplanted by St. Peters and others.  The really interesting thing about Hagia Sofia is that it was converted to a Mosque.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> Check out the apse of the church in this next picture.  Notice that the alcove is not centered.  This is because even though the church was sited east to west, the axis was just eleven degrees off of the line to Mecca.  Because Muslims do not allow for images in their mosques all of the mosaics were covered in whitewash and then painted over in more typical muslim designs.  Except for the Seraphim.   Look at the two images below:</p>

<p>Notice that the only difference here is that the face was painted over with a symetric diamond shape.  Some of the mosaics that they have begun to uncover and restore are really stunning.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9296ce71f2.jpg" alt="Hagia Sophia"></p>
<p>Finally, we visited the cistern under the basilica.  You may remember this from James Bond, &ldquo;To Russia with Love.&rdquo;  It is just this giant underground place that used to provide water to the city.  But now, it is just stunning:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/17c53e026e.jpg" alt="The Cistern"></p>
<p>After all of that we headed back to the hotel for a short rest before we took the students out for a group dinner.  We were all plenty exhausted after such an interesting day.  Tomorrow, the Grand Bazaar, the Spice Market, and Taksim square.</p>

			 <p>Think you have done it all in London?  The museums, the London Eye, the changing of the guard, the Thames, the list goes on.  Here is a great way to spend a day, for almost no money. Rent a Barclay&rsquo;s bike and head for the Regents Canal.  This is exactly what we did and it was a fantastic way to enjoy London away from the traffic and the museums.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll discover a whole different culture and way of life when you bike along the canal.  There are hundreds of narrow small barges that people live on or work the canal on.  We saw all walks of life that appeared to be barge owners, from the very wealthy to those who reminded us of the people in Veitnam who lived on their boats with no heat or running water.</p>
<p>The path is fairly narrow, so you have to be alert or you could get wet, which would definitely spoil an otherwise good day.   Also you need to remember that pedestrians have the right of way, so just be polite, use your little bell, and don&rsquo;t go too fast!   We didn&rsquo;t have any trouble, and we enjoyed all of the scenery and the side trips that are available from the canal path.</p>
<p>On day one we started from Angel, and followed the path toward the London Docklands.  It was warm and scenic, and gave us a great taste of barge life on the canal.  We wandered around the (free) docklands museum, hoping to learn a bit more about the canals, but were disappointed.  The docklands museum is actually a very interesting history of London, so that was not disappointing, just that the museum didn&rsquo;t have anything to say about the canal.</p>
<p>On day two we went the other way, and ended up having lunch in the rather bohemian Camden Market area.  We also took a side trip around the zoo and the royal gardens to see some incredible villas that have been built right along the canal.</p>

<p>I love London.  It is probably my favorite big city in the world. I think I have visited at least six times.  So I have done the museums and most of the good tourist attractions.   My top five  would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Transportation Museum in Covent Garden</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The science museum in Kensington</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Imperial War Museum</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our visit to Parliament</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Westminster Abbey</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a really great alternative way to spend the better part of two days enjoying London culture from the perspective of a cyclist.</p>
<p>As a bonus part of this post, I do have to admit that I had never done the London Eye until this visit. It was definitely a fun way to get a view of the city.  Jane and I both did a little bit of experimenting with time lapse videos on our iPhones.  I wish I had brought my tripod so I could have captured the entire circle.</p>

			 <p>The first words I read as my phone synced up email in the passport control line at Luton were &ldquo;still no tickets.&rdquo;  The message went on to explain that the tickets were still supposed to be delivered by eleven PM  by someone named Jamie who is running behind schedule.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1b7732109c.jpg" alt="Wembley Stadium"></p>
<p>Getting tickets to the FA cup game is no easy trick.  All of the tickets allocated to both clubs (Arsenal and Reading) were sold out to season ticket holders well in advance, so visitors like us are left trying to buy tickets online from third parties at crazy high prices.  Yes, its crazy to pay over $300 to go to a soccer match.  Yes, I paid it willingly!  We  did some research, so we think this is a reputable source of tickets but you have to put a certain amount of trust in strangers in order to get your tickets.</p>
<p>After the train ride into Farringdon station we walk over to the apartment we had rented through AirBnB, another exercise in trusting strangers, and are rewarded with exactly the fantastic two bedroom apartment we were promised.  The owner met us at the door and showed us around.  He had purchased us some breakfast items, and some fruit, and a nice bottle of wine.  The apartment is on a Kings Mews street, which is nice and quiet so no problem with street noise either.</p>
<p>Jim and Josh arrived a few minutes later with Jim&rsquo;s luggage.  We got a two bedroom so we could share with Jim and so he would not have to spend the entire long weekend in Josh&rsquo;s student housing.  Which after seeing it, I am glad we did!</p>
<p>As 11:00 came and went, we still had no tickets.  So we were preparing ourselves for the worst, which is really not too bad considering our apartment has a 56 inch big screen for the backup plan.  We were all a bit nervous, but found some good entertainment value in the chat that Josh had been having with customer support at the ticket agency.</p>

<p>Sweet dreams indeed!  By 9:00 the next morning, we got the good news that we had tickets in hand.  The problem was that  they were not in the category we had paid for.  They were not bad tickets!  In fact they were really good.  Row 8 on the first level, but they were in the corner so we would be looking at the field the long way.  Since the website said tickets were fully refundable if you did not receive tickets in the category you paid for you were eligible for a full refund.  So we got online and complained a bit.  The first response was that we had been upgraded, and that these were actually better tickets than we had ordered <strong>for this game</strong>.   LOL.</p>
<p>Shortly after this conversation we received a call saying that they had tickets for us in the area we had ordered.  However these were way up in the nosebleed area, and we would be split two and two.  about this same time we also noticed that two of our tickets had post-it notes attached with the note that they were Junior tickets.   Hmmm, maybe we got the wrong tickets?  Maybe they need to swap with us to get these to some guy and his two kids.   Well, we reasoned, we don&rsquo;t have to meet this guy and get the other tickets, possession is 90% of the law.  So we began to think about breakfast.  But before we all met up for breakfast,  we got an email from Karen, who had been woken up at 3AM back in the US by a call from Thomas, who wanted us to call him on his mobile.</p>
<p>It turned out that Thomas also had tickets, but said they  were &ldquo;VIP tickets.&rdquo;  Karmic payback for being &ldquo;one of the kindest people I spoke to in this chat support ever&rdquo;?    Maybe!  Two of these new tickets included access to a table in the Bobby Moore hospitality area (free pre-game meal and drinks), and two of them were &ldquo;merely&rdquo; on the Wembly Gold (free budweiser at halftime) level.   So, in less than 12 hours we had gone from zero tickets to tickets that were beyond anything we could have imagined.  These tickets would be delivered to us by another delivery person, and then we were to meet Thomas near Wembly to return the four we originally had received.  The new courier arrived at our apartment in a shiny white Range Rover, and delivered our packets of tickets.  They all looked legit, and we all had great seats right on the halfway line!   Now all we had to do was find Thomas and hand over the old tickets.  Those young children might get to see the game with their dad yet.</p>
<p>As we made the walk from the Wembley tube station towards the stadium we had many opportunities to sell our four extras.  We thought that we might even make a profit, but our honesty and the fact that we had VIP tickets in hand, put us in the mood to  carry on to our meeting point and keep up our end of the bargain.  It is interesting to think about the business model and operations of a third party ticket seller.  They are selling the tickets to us at a significant markup, but the tickets have to come from somewhere.  So they have to be able to forecast in advance how many tickets from each area they will probably have, and then they need to get those tickets from the original owners to the new buyers.  Its no wonder a lot of the transactions come down to the wire.</p>
<p>Our tickets allowed us into the stadium well in advance of the game so we had plenty of time to soak up the atmosphere and check out all of our food, beverage and gift shop options.  As we were standing in the gift shop I saw one young man in Reading blue from head to toe, with a big foam blue finger call out to his dad.  His voice was shaking with excitement as his big blue finger pointed to a rack of merchandise.  LIVERPOOL he said with longing.  The dad just melted into the ground.  I guess you can&rsquo;t control who your kids will choose for their football team, even in England.</p>
<p>As a fan of the Men in Blazers show, I was very excited to see that meat pies were available everywhere in the stadium.  Tom&rsquo;s pies to be exact.  So I enjoyed a very nice Guinness and roast beef pie as a pre-game meal.  It is true, they are quite good.  flakey crust, stringy tender roast beef and gravy on the inside, just like Sunday dinner back home.  So, here is the obligatory food shot!  You might also notice the betting sheet on the left side of the photo.  You can bet on almost anything right there at the game.  Final score, who will score, when will they score, who will score first, etc.  It was too complicated for us so we left the betting up to others and saved our money for sausages and more food later.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/60cd500bdd.jpg" alt="beef pie"></p>
<p>The game itself turned out to be good.  It wasn&rsquo;t Arsenal&rsquo;s best performance of the year.  But I blame that on Wenger for going away from the lineup that had us winning nine in a row.  I would not have substituted Welbeck for Giroud, but I am not the manager.   Nevertheless Alexis scored a great goal just before halftime and I was feeling good.  A strong pep talk in the locker room and surely we would come out and seal the game with a couple more goals.  It turned out that the opposite happened.  Reading came out fired up and scored an equalizer, and we looked like we were playing &ldquo;not to lose&rdquo;  which is our worst strategy.   At the end of regulation it was Arsenal 1 - 1 Reading.   OVERTIME!  We were really getting our moneys worth out of these great seats.  As long as we win in overtime and don&rsquo;t go to penalties life is good  Which is what happened.  shortly before the end of the first extra period Alexis scored again.  It was kind of a sad screw up for the Reading keeper, but a victory is a victory!</p>

			 <p>Somehow the midpoint of this journey escaped my notice.  Its not surprising as it has been a busy and amazing two weeks, full of new cultures and new experiences.    <!-- raw HTML omitted --> But, this morning we have time to just relax, watch the sea outside our room, and think about our experiences over the last three months.  In total we will be gone for 179 days!  That is a long time to be away from family and friends and the comforts of home.  But the time has gone by quickly, and will only accelerate as we head towards the end.</p>
<p>I took a few minutes this morning to put together this map.  The red pins show everywhere we have been since January 1, 2015 and the green pins show all the places we have yet to visit before we arrive back home on June 28th.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So, what do I take away from this journey so far?  I would like to break it up into three themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The expanse of history</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The variety of culture</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The challenges of living away from home</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="history">History</h3>
<p>I never would have guessed that a new understanding and appreciation for world history would have been one of my biggest takeaways from this experience, but it is certainly shaping up to be that way.  A big reason for this has been  the history course at the University of Malta, and seeing the evidence of history everywhere you turn.  You go to Valletta and you can&rsquo;t escape seeing the walls and the buildings left behind by the Knights of St. John&rsquo;s.  You visit other places and see the Megalithic temples or evidence of the Romans or Phonecians or the  Ottoman Empire.  But what is really cool is that now when we leave Malta I have a much better appreciation for the timescale and the artifacts left behind by these same people in other parts of the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The scope of the Roman empire is simply amazing.  As we were standing among the Roman ruins in Volubilis Morocco, we could just as easily have been standing in Ostia Antica in Italy.  The frescos on the floor looked the same, the aqueducts and walls were identical to those we have seen in Italy, France, and Spain.  Now we flew, on a jet, and drove in a fast car to all of these places.  Its really hard to imagine how an empire like this managed when the way to travel was on horse, or foot, or camel.  There was no internet to get word back to headquarters so its easy to imagine that important information would be lost or take many months to get from place to place.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> In Malta, the arabic influence is clearly heard in the language, but not so much in the architecture.  However  now that we have traveled to Morocco and Spain it  is interesting to see the influences of the Ottoman empire in both places.  It is also interesting to see how all of the different empires recycled and reused materials from their predecessors.  Mosques built from the stones of Christian churches and vice versa.  Churches that still bear signs of a mosque built from stones taken from a prehistoric temple.  I am really excited to visit Istanbul in a few weeks to see this city where Islaam and Christianity have coexisted for so many centuries.</p>
<p>I think that I have developed a better appreciation for the timescale of history.  When we hear that at one time Malta was predominantly Muslim, but now Christian, or that the Berbers of Morocco were predominantly Jewish but are now Muslim you wonder how did that happen?  Slowly.  These are changes that took place over hundreds of years.  Longer than the United States has been a country!  Back home we might say, look at this old building, it has been around since 1849.  That is barely a blip in the timescale of the history here in the Mediterranean.  At the same time, I have developed a new appreciation for the importance of preserving our own historical artifacts for future generations to study and learn from.</p>
<h3 id="cultural-variety">Cultural Variety</h3>
<p>Living on internet time, it is easy to think that everything and everyone has always changed as fast as it does today.  But, it is easy to see that this is not true.  In the pueblos blancos of Spain, the towns of Malta, and the villages of Vietnam and Cambodia, things don&rsquo;t move so fast.  People still fix their old televisions and home appliances rather than just toss them aside after five years.  In the medinas of Morocco and the villages of the Mekong delta people still use every part of every animal and plant.  Husks of rice kernels are used to fire the kilns for making bricks, every part of the cow or goat or camel is used for something.</p>
<p>I love to observe the old men in the different places that we visit.  They are the same everywhere! If I was a better photographer I would ask their permission so that I could take their pictures and share them.  On my walk to the University in Malta ther are three guys that sit on the sidewalk every morning, talking and arguing and solving the worlds problems.  In Spain we saw them in the small towns, having coffee when we would stop for our own mid-morning break from cycling.  Having a coffee, and talking, arguing, and solving the worlds problems. In Morocco they gather for their tea and they talk and they argue and they solve the worlds problems.  They supervise local construction projects everywhere. It is the same in Decorah as well: at the Back Home bakery, or the Oneota country club, or happy hour at Rubaiyat. In Decorah, I know the names of most of the men, and am slowly beginning to join their ranks.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Morocco was my first experience in traveling in a predominantly Muslim country.  Vietnam and Cambodia are predominantly Buddhist.  Malta is strongly Christian.  Of course there are big differences in all of these religions, but the main thing that strikes me is that the people who practice any of these religions have much more in common than you might think.  Of course, as our Moroccan guide noted, there are crazy Christians and crazy Muslims and crazy Jews who cause trouble, but the non-crazy people want to live good, healthy, peaceful lives.  People of all faiths love their children and their neighbors and want to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>Talking about religion,  you can&rsquo;t ignore Football (soccer).  Soccer is another great unifier of people.  If you are a soccer fan, you can find a friend almost anywhere.  We have enjoyed watching the English Premier League in every country we have visited.  Of course in Spain it was a bit more of a challenge as La Liga dominates here.  But we have always been able to find a pub that carries the game.  People everywhere know Arsenal and Manchester United.  More importantly, they love to talk about their local team.   I love to ask the waiters or the porters  in the hotels if they are soccer fans and who they support.  They are always a bit surprised to find an American that is an avid futball fan.   Is soccer really growing in America? How did you become a fan?  What will happen with the MLS? Are you happy that Steven Gerrard is joining the LA Galaxy?  How many years will it be until the USA dominates in the world cup?</p>
<h3 id="living-away-from-home">Living away from home</h3>
<p>When we left home in January Jane and I talked about how this would be a great experiment.  Would we be ready to be snowbirds?  Would we miss our friends too much to leave Decorah for six months?  What would it be like to make friends in a totally different culture?  It turns out that this was a flawed experiment.</p>
<p>Although we have settled in to a flat in Malta its hard to compare this to what it would be like to have our own place in California or Arizona.  Although the flat is perfectly livable it is not ours, it is not even something that we would choose if given the chance to look around.  And, because we do not own the place and are only there for five months, we can&rsquo;t really change it.  No painting, no updating, so Nespresso coffee maker.  So we live with what we have, which is very different from how we would do things if it were our own.</p>
<p>I am grateful for my own research work.  It has been nice to have some time to really sit back and think about the direction my research and work on <a href="http://runestoneinteractive.org">Runestone Interactive</a> will need to take over the next few years.  I have learned that I am far from ready to retire or give up the exciting work that I do on this project and with students at Luther.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> The people we have met in Malta are very nice, but we have not made new friends.  Building relationships takes time and investment, and it is hard for others to invest when our time in Malta is so short.  It is hard for us to invest when our time is short. It makes us think about being more welcoming and open to new friends back home.  It is easy to settle in to the same comfortable group of friends week after week.  It is much harder to break out and invite new people into the circle.  Mike and Shirley do a much better job of that than anyone!</p>
<p>So, we have settled in to a routine that largely centers around the students and ourselves.  Occasionally  we have gone out with another couple, but this is fairly rare.  We have Skyped or Facetimed with our friends and family back home and have really enjoyed those times as much as anything.  Technology is a wonderful way to connect.  All of those Jetsons cartoons I watched where they  used the video phone have come true.  So, although we have always valued our friends, we have learned how important those friendships are on a much deeper level than we knew before.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Although we have traveled many thousands of miles, and logged many nights in hotels and restaurants, it is important to stop and realize that this journey has been an inward journey as well.  I am thankful for the growth and learning that this experience has brought so far, and I eagerly await the new experiences yet to come.  As we prepare to pack up and head to the airport this afternoon, I find that I cannot say we are going home.  Home will come soon, we will be home when we are back in Decorah and with friends and family on</p>
<p>Bone Lake.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Malaga to Antequera:  Tonight we stayed at the Convento Magadaleno after a very difficult ride through the Sierra del Torcal.  24 miles in the heat and a lot of climbing.  We checked in to the convent, and then used the spa.  Dinner was outside in one of the small hill towns close to the convent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>El-Chorro to Ronda   Through the Sierra de las Neives.  We had seen El-Chorro from the train on the way to Malaga and were excited to bike here.  It is beautiful.  The afternoon climb was a bit much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ronda - out and back to Grazalema  &ndash; Jane stayed in Ronda to explore while I went out for the day.  The ride to Grazalema was great, and the hill town was cool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Olive trees in Granada:  Tonight we moved to the Barcelo La Bobadilla.  A wonderful five star hotel, with great restaurants and a good spa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lunch in Iznajar:  We skipped the crazy hard climb to start out the day, and coasted downhill instead.  However since all hill towns are at the top of hills we still had a climb to finish off our riding and get a well deserved lunch in this cool town.</p>

			 <p>After a week in Morocco, Jane and I are now biking in the Andalusia region of Spain.  Whereas Morocco was a bit of a mental and cultural challenge the biking is definitely a physical challenge!  On day one we covered 24 miles and climbed 4,400 feet.  On day two 27 miles and 6,600 feet.  That is definitely a PR for me in terms of climbing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sitting in the hotel room this morning with mixed emotions.  Its quite windy and cool outside this morning and I&rsquo;m thinking of all of the climbing ahead of me, and my legs are a  bit on the worn out side.  On the other hand, we have seen some great scenery, this is really beautiful country.  Jane made her decision yesterday, she is getting a massage, she is going shopping, she is pretty smart.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Fast forward to 5:00 I am back from biking, my legs are tired another 24 miles, not so much elevation today, only 3,500 feet.  But I don&rsquo;t mind, my legs are tired.   Did I already mention that?  Today I rode with Flynn, he is a young Australian, and an avid rock climber as well as cyclist.  On our way out to Grazelema  for lunch, we stopped at a hiking trail with a nice overlook of an ancient dam.  The dam is very interesting as it was built in the early 19th century by workers working round the clock eight hour shifts.  However after the dam was finished they discovered that they had used the wrong kind of stone, and it leaked badly.  They were never able to repair the dam and make it usable for generating electricity, and so it was abandoned without ever being used.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/09efd34855.jpg" alt="dam"></p>
<p>At lunch we decided that exploring around the dam would be a good diversion.  Especially if we could walk out on top of it!  So we rode the van back to the hiking area and started our way down.  We were rewarded with some pretty spectacular views.  As usual, its the unplanned side-trips that turn out to be the most interesting.</p>

<p>To summarize the trip to date, we have had some great food and stayed at some wonderful hotels.  Our first night was in an old convent  - convento magdalena &ndash; in the Andalusian countryside.  nestled in between the mountain peaks it was very secluded and a great place to start our rest and relaxation.  The picture below shows the clouds spilling over the mountain.  They would come across the top and fall down into the valley, then they would rise up again and disappear before our eyes.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e7e2ccce5e.jpg" alt="clouds"></p>
<p>Day 2 brought us to the town of Ronda where we are spending two nights at the hotel Reina Victoria.  It is obviously a popular biking stop as groups from Trek and Backroads are also staying here.  The hotel has a nice spa, and we have a fabulous view out the window of our room.  The view is because we are at the edge of town and right on the edge of a cliff.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8b8e7d58f4.jpg" alt="Ronda"></p>
<p>Ronda is a fascinating little town.  A medieval village with Phoenician, Roman, and Arab walls.  The whole town is on top of a highly defensible outcropping of rock.  You would have to go steeply uphill, or straight up a cliff from almost any direction in order to attack the town.  Ronda is divided into the old part which has the traditional &ldquo;pueblos blancos&rdquo;  and the new part.  The two halves are joined by the &ldquo;new bridge&rdquo; built in the seventeenth century.  It is quite a marvel of engineering for that day!</p>

			 <h1 id="lost-in-the-souks">Lost in the Souks</h1>
<p>As I dropped Jane and Tricia off at the spa for their pedicure the young
man at the door said with a grin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you 20 camels for your
daughter!&rdquo; Oh crap, I thought, not another session of haggling!</p>
<p>Not my daughter I said.</p>
<p>Oh, no problem, then 20 camels for her <strong>and</strong> 20 camels for you.</p>
<p>Great, I have nine more like her! I&rsquo;ll be back later.</p>
<p>We shook hands laughing and parted ways. Such is the life in the
Marrakech markets. For the record, I&rsquo;m just kidding Angel, Jenna,
Meredith, Meredith, Tricia, Rachel, Erika, Olivia, Katie and Emma! I
would hold out for at least thirty camels a piece.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/add42e55b5.jpg" alt="The women are worth 200 camels, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ll do with theguys."></p>
<p>Joking aside, traveling with 10 &ldquo;daughters.&rdquo; did present a few
challenges. Before we left, we had discussed with the students that
Morocco has not come as far in the area of Women&rsquo;s rights as the United
States and many other european countries. This was hammered home for us
as we drove into Marrakech and our guide told us breathlessly that in
Marrakech we would see something new and very different... (long pause)
Women on motor scooters!</p>
<p>Before we left we told our &ldquo;daughters&rdquo; that it was important to adopt
a more conservative style of dress for this trip. Cover your shoulders,
no tank-tops and no short-shorts we said. And they all followed this,
although next time I would explicitly add running tights to my list of
items to not wear. We heard a few mutters from our students as we saw
female tourists from other countries in revealing outfits. Nevertheless,
our daughters stuck out, the long blond hair, and blue eyes (and,
unfortunately, the running tights) were a real attraction for many of
the local young men.</p>
<p>We learned that sixteen year old boys are idiots no matter where you are
in the world. One night a group of boys followed five of the daughters
back from a restaurant. Although they said they were not in danger, it
was definitely an uncomfortable situation for them to be ogled and
followed down the narrow dark streets of the medina by this small group.
Other times we all heard the whistles or moans and comments from men of
all ages as the group walked by. When you walked in the back of the
group it was painfully obvious to watch the heads turn and stare as the
group went by. I&rsquo;m hoping that some of them will write about this from
their own perspective in their journals or blogs and that we can have
further conversation about this back in Malta.</p>
<p>Today is our last day of traveling with the students for the Malta
Easter break. Tomorrow we go our separate directions. The students to
Amsterdam, Belgium, Germany, England, Greece and the Czek Republic. Jane
and I to southern Spain.</p>
<p>It has been an amazing trip, Morocco is surprisingly beautiful at every
turn. We have learned a lot about this country, its history, its culture
and its people. The people are cheerful, and as you can see from the
exchange above they have a great sense of humor.</p>
<p>Nowhere is that sense of humor more evident than in the Souks, the great
marketplace of Marrakech. They say that you haven&rsquo;t been to Marrakech
if you haven&rsquo;t gotten lost in the Souks. So, we did. There are
thousands and thousands of small shops, all arranged in a twisty maze
seemingly designed to draw you deeper and deeper so that you have to
pass by even more shops to get out.</p>
<p>There are leather shops, wool and agave silk dyeing shops, wood shops,
copper and silver shops, shops with tagines of all shapes and sizes.
Nothing has a price on it of course, which is what makes the whole thing
such an adventure. You have to be careful about even looking too hard at
anything or the shop keeper will come up to you and draw you into the
store, if you ask the price, you must be prepared for something beyond
anything you are willing to pay.</p>
<p>We were offered &ldquo;student prices,&rdquo; &ldquo;democratic prices,&rdquo; &ldquo;special
price for friends from America prices,&rdquo; and more. Its all part of the
game. leather bags and purses that started out at over one thousand
durhams could be had for 250 to 500, depending on their quality and the
willingness of the bargainer to simply walk out of the shop and leave
the poor shopkeeper looking sad.</p>
<dl>
<dt>We were coached:</dt>
<dd>
<p>I make you a price now you make me a price. What if I don&rsquo;t want
this? Its ok, we will still be friends. Now make me a price.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When Jane came back with an offer that was too low on a purse the
shopkeeper was deeply hurt and began to put all of the stuffing back in
the purse. &ldquo;For that you can buy a camel purse.&rdquo; A few moments later
when one of our students volunteered her to come up 50 durham (about
$5), the sale was cheerfully closed, and we were all friends again.</p>
<p>We had demonstrations of quality. Lighters held up to leather, &ldquo;if this
was camel leather it would burst into flames, but this is good cow
leather.&rdquo; fingers were licked and run across the died leather, to
demonstrate that the color did not in fact come off when the leather got
wet.</p>
<p>We had another seminar on spices and their medicinal properties of
varous spices and aphrodesiac properties of various herbs. &ldquo;Except for
you,&rdquo; she said to one of the young men in our group. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need
this!&rdquo; This time the seminar ended with extra large shopping baskets
being passed out to everyone. Then she started over going through each
item again with a chance to purchase. I have a nice package of Nigella
seeds that will clear my nose and help my asthma. In addition to some
nice Morrocan curry and Harissa.</p>
<p><img src="/images/Marrakech/spicerack.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Jane and I are now in the Marrakech airport. The students are safely on
their way, and we have a little longer to wait before we can check in
and make our way through security. From here we will travel to Seville
then Malaga where we will meet our guides for our bike trip for the next
few days.</p>

			 <h1 id="a-visit-to-the-kasbah">A visit to the Kasbah</h1>
<p>Sometimes when you are travelling it is the unplanned things that can
surprise you the most. At dinner last night we decided to stick around
town this morning and visit the Ksar (fortified city). At breakfast,
Mohammed, the owner of the Hotel Bagdhad Cafe was happy to line up a
guide, also named Mohammed, for us at the last minute, giving him an
unconditional recommendation as the best guide in town. As it turns out
he may very well be. Mohammed is part of one of eight families that
still live in Ksir Ait Ben Haddou, a very old city that is also featured
in several movies including Jewel of the Nile and Gladiator.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/0b85d4f07a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The houses in the Ksar are made of big clay and straw bricks for the
very practical reason that they keep the temperature down to a
comfortable level even when the outside temperature reaches 49 degrees
C. Remember to convert that to F you double it which is already a warm
98 degrees, but then add 32! The Ksar is built into the side of a steep
hill, so as we went up from the lower part of the town to the upper the
views became more spectacular.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/3b6a3f6924.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>At about the midway point of our climb our guide stopped outside his own
house. &ldquo;You are welcome here&rdquo; he said. This is a phrase we have heard
everywhere in Morocco from many different people. It is a phrase that
our guide has said to us as we enter each new city we are stopping in.
It is a phrase I&rsquo;ve been thinking about all day. It has a much
different feel than &ldquo;welcome to Fez.&rdquo; it is at once more personal,
more authentic, and in a place where we wondered whether we really would
be welcome it is is quite comforting.</p>
<p>We had a stop at a local artists studio where he was painting with
indigo, Saffron, and &ldquo;berber whiskey&rdquo; the green mint tea that you get
everywhere in Morocco. The interesting thing about the tea is that it is
when you paint with it it acts like invisible ink. You can&rsquo;t see it
until you heat it up. So he paints the picture and it looks like there
are pieces missing until he holds the picture over the flame and reveals
the finished work. At only $5.00 a painting many in our group bought a
picture to remember this part of the trip by.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the tour we came upon a mosque which is still in
daily use. Right next to the mosque was a synagogue, no longer in use.
The history of the Berber people is very old, and interesting. At one
time the majority of the Berber&rsquo;s were Jewish, then for a time the
majority were Christian, but now they have been Muslim for a long time.
We&rsquo;ve heard a similar story about the Maltese, although they are now
Christian. This change in religiion does not happen over night, of
course, it happens over generations. The result for the Berbers is that
they are peaceful, and very tolerant.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/a7e6b628de.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>We want to get along with all people our guide told us. He went on, the
problems in the world today are caused by three things: money, politics,
and crazy people -- Crazy Jews, Crazy Muslims, and Crazy Christians.
Most people are good and peaceful people, its a shame the crazy people
have to ruin it. Thats a pretty succinct way of summing up the state of
things in the world. It was also an echo to commnents made by a previous
guide about &ldquo;idiots in Iraq&rdquo; destroying relics of their own ancient
heritage. Clearly no one religion has cornered the market on crazy
people. It seems that during our travels those we have met have gone out
of their way to emphasize that most Muslims are peace loving people that
don&rsquo;t have any ill will towards us. I think its the same for me. I&rsquo;m
embarrassed by the crazy Christians as much as they are embarrassed by
the crazy Mulsims. The more important question is what to do about the
crazies?</p>
<p>In our travels this year we have encountered amazing people of all
faiths, Buddhists in Vietnam, and Cambodia, Muslims in Morocco, and
Christians in Rome and Malta. It is these people that have made the past
months memorable. On this Easter weekend, it is a bit strange to be in a
Muslim country knowing the Easter celebrations going on back home.</p>
<p>I wish all of our friends and neighbors far and wide Peace, and a
blessed Easter.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6db7c83902.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>&ldquo;Camel noses!&rdquo; came the answer from the back of our mini-bus. The
question was &ldquo;what is one memory or thought you would take away from
yesterday?&rdquo; Other thoughts about yesterday centered around the bookends
of sunrise and sunset, changes in geography, the orange of the dunes
against the blue sky, the beauty of the desert sunset, and the
awesomeness of being present in the place and the moment.</p>
<p>Note: This is an expanded version of a post that I wrote for Luther&rsquo;s
Ideas and Creations blog.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/93c0445670.jpg" alt="image">{width=&ldquo;200px&rdquo;}</p>
<p>So, where were we? We began our day watching the sunrise on the rooftop
terrace of our Riad in the ancient city of Fez Morocco. From there we
travelled through the Middle Atlas Mountains with stops for a snowball
fight and monkey feeding. We descended from the mountains into the
plains where we travelled through towns abandoned with the overland
spice trade. Ultimately, the plains turn to desert with high plateaus.
We experienced the wonder of coming around a bend and seeing a valley
oasis, full of Date Palms. We ended our day about 35 kilometers from the
Algerian border, at a desert camp site watching the sun set over the
Moroccan desert. It was quite a day.</p>
<p>We arrived just after 6pm at the auberge where we met our guides for the
night. We tied up our turbans and mounted our camels. This was a new
experience for all but one of our group. As we rode out of the hotel
area and into the dunes, each camel got a name. We also learned that
camels are not the most comfortable beasts to ride. But it was fun, and
a great shared learning experience for everyone.</p>
<p>Many of the students shared a sentiment along the lines of &ldquo;Holy Crap!
How did I get so lucky to be here on a sand dune in the middle of the
desert?&rdquo; If you haven&rsquo;t experienced the quiet beauty of desert sand
dunes you should add it to your bucket list. As one member of the group
said, &ldquo;it is just sand, but it is really beautiful.&rdquo; For me, the word
that has stuck in my head throughout our time here in Morocco has been
authentic. The leather tanneries of Fez are not selling mass produced
goods. The marketplace is a real working marketplace. The dunes are not
arranged for our viewing pleasure. You will find no dune gardeners out
there arranging things and picking up the trash. The wind and the sand
take care of the cleaning. Last night&rsquo;s footprints were erased by the
breeze that came up early this morning.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/092c605002.jpg" alt="Desert sunset"></p>
<p>After enjoying the sunset at the top of one of the taller (160 feet)
dunes, we came down to our little nomadic camp in the valley where our
guides, four young men, served us tea. We talked with them a bit about
how the recent attack in Tunisia has had very negative impact on tourism
in Morocco. It is sad for them, as this is such a beautiful country, and
we have felt safe and warmly welcomed almost everywhere. At length, tea
was followed by a Moroccan meal. There was a rice salad with tuna and
tomato, onion, peppers and oranges. followed by a tagine filled with
potatoes, carrots, and beef. For desert, oranges and apples. After
cleaning up a bit our guides returned with traditional African drums and
played and sang for us.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5b6597a40e.jpg" alt="Jane and I in the setting sun"></p>
<p>There were no distractions from this group experience as we had no cell
service and no WiFi. They sang some traditional Moroccan songs for us.
All of them were Muslim, and at least two of them came from Berber
backgrounds. There was a bit of dancing by Jenna and Angel, and drum
lessons for a few. When they finished they asked us to sing for them. It
was a little bit sad how hard we had to struggle to think of a song
everyone knew. The nostalgic part of me thinks that could be because we
need more nights of face to face entertainment, and fewer with WiFi. The
other parts of me are happy to be writing this post on my iPad knowing I
can upload it and all the pictures from almost anywhere else. In the
end, Ethan, Ben, and I were the brave one&rsquo;s and we gave our best
rendition of the college hymn, &ldquo;To Luther.&rdquo; A bit later the
appropriate beat inspired a rousing rendition of &ldquo;We Will Rock You&rdquo;
with Ben taking the lead and showing a part of himself that I hadn&rsquo;t
seen yet.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/d703689775.jpg" alt="image">{width=&ldquo;200px&rdquo;}</p>
<p>This morning, when I got to the top of the dune to watch the sun rise, I
found a water bottle left over from a previous group. The wind had blown
the sand over and around the bottle leaving a very interesting pattern
on the leeward side. A miniature example of the sand dunes and the
desert as a whole. I don&rsquo;t know what the last two days will mean for
the students in the long run. I don&rsquo;t even know how today&rsquo;s experience
will shape my own future. But I know it will, as each past travel
adventure has left its mark. It strikes me that the bottle and the dunes
are a great metaphor for study abroad and Lutheran higher education. We
can lecture for hours, and give them days of homework, but it is these
experiences that will shape our students in ways we cannot possibly
imagine or plan.</p>

			 <h1 id="morocco----sensory-and-cultural-overload">Morocco -- Sensory and Cultural Overload</h1>
<p>As I sit here on the rooftop terrace of our Riad in the Medina of Fez,
the sky is turing purple as the sun begins to set. The Minarets have
just become active as the call to prayer begins from every direction.
I&rsquo;m trying my best to write down my thoughts now because I&rsquo;m so
overloaded after the day we have just had I want to record my reactions
now rather than tomorrow.</p>
<p>Today we smelled and tasted 20 different spices in the spice market,
tasted four different kinds of Moroccan flat bread, half a dozen
different kinds of dates, more olives than I&rsquo;ve eaten in my life,
Chickpeas with cumin and chile, a dozen different kinds of honey, each
with its own medicinal purpose, tea made of mint and absynthe, Fava bean
soup, and beef cheeks and tongue. We visited a bakery that bakes
everything from bread to stuffed spleen. In the words of one particular
Gozotan guide, I must say this was the best marketplace tour ever. The
market just seems to go on forever in every possible direction.</p>
<p>It was very interesting, and slightly uncomfortable in the places that
we ate. These are very small stalls in the marketplace and in several
cases the owner literally kicked out other customers to make room for
our entire group. To help you imagine the size of the place I am writing
about, imagine a king size bed. On three sides of the bed you have walls
going to the ceiling, Leave about a foot between your imaginary walls
and a table in the middle of the space. Now take 14 people and get them
around the three sides. In every case one or more Moroccans were sent
next door in order to make room for all of us to eat together. They
didn&rsquo;t seem to mind, as they seemed happy to observe us and to share
their food and culture.</p>
<p>The streets are narrow, no cars are allowed in the Medina, but donkeys
and handcarts are! We learned some new words Ballack! Get out of the
way. That is especially important when the donkeys laden with gas tanks
are coming by. Or when the garbage donkeys are hauling out the trash.
Also: Yellah, follow me, Shukran, thank you.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/b59c51ec73.jpg" alt="Make way for the donkeys"></p>
<p>The mass of people was quite overwhelming for me, shouldering my way
through the crowds has never been high on my list. Navigating through
streets that are sometimes barely wide enough for one person to walk on,
brings it to a whole new level. But, the people here have welcomed us
very warmly. They are eager to share their culture and city with us even
though we blonde haired blue eyed Lutherans stand out like crazy amongst
the many other colors of this melting pot city.</p>
<p>The smells also had a huge effect on me. From the pungent spices, to the
citrus smells, to the produce (in all stages of freshness) to the
various different meats being cooked and/or butchered. Every time you
turn a corner you are subjected to / assaulted with a new smell. Perhaps
the best of this was at the spice market. The proprietor gave us a 45
minute seminar on spices and all of their medicinal purposes. The
highlight was when he had us all sniff black anise powder. WOW, in terms
of a sinus clearing activity you just can&rsquo;t beat it.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/3688538e8b.jpg" alt="The spice man giving us a seminar on spices and their medicinalproperties"></p>
<p>Morocco is primarily a Muslim country, although they pride themselves on
being quite progressive and peaceful. One of the most profound moments
of the day came as we were visiting a madrasa. Our guide, Achmed was
telling us about the training they receive and the importance of
incorporating science into their training. In addition to memorizing the
Koran having a sound understanding of science is an important part of
religious training. In a way, Morocco is the cradle of much of science.
When Europe was in the dark ages, scientific studies flourished in
Morocco. In a world where many in our own country are all too quick to
call climate change a theory, or evolution a fiction, it is fascinating
to hear what an integral part of religious training science is in Muslim
world. This is especially interesting when those same people are all too
quick to paint all Muslims with the same brush.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/b06d89d609.jpg" alt="The group in the madrasa"></p>
<p>During our tour, we all did our best to be good ambassadors for the
United States, Luther College, and ourselves. This meant dressing a bit
more conservatively than some would normally do. It means being polite
and greeting strangers in the market with a smile. It means respecting
people and not taking their picture without getting permission first.
Its amazing how such simple things can pave the way to better
relationships with the people you meet.</p>

			 <h1 id="were-driving-in-our-car">We&rsquo;re driving in our Car</h1>
<p>One thing we never thought we would do in Malta was drive a car. From
the way our neighbors fly down the road, to the fact that nobody uses
turn signals (actually that is the same practice as back home) to the
fact that it appears to be impossible to find a parking spot in our
neighborhood it just didn&rsquo;t seem worth the trouble. We can walk to
almost everything we need, and with some patience take the bus almost
anywhere else. However, when one of our students sprained her ankle and
we discovered just how long it was going to take her to bus to school,
we decided to give driving a shot. It was especially easy when we found
out we could rent one for about $5.00 a day!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/055cc756e3.jpg" alt="Our Chevy Spark. Not as big as a Volt. (or aVespa)"></p>
<p>It is an experiment that has been modestly successful, but one that
we&rsquo;ll be glad to see the back side of in a week. Yes, it is nerve
wracking, yes, parking is a pain, and yes, people just honk their horns
for no good reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Really dude behind me? Don&rsquo;t you think I would get out of your way if
I could? But there are 20 cars stopped in front of me and nobody is
going anywhere so just calm the heck down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the positive side the car has allowed us to enjoy the island in ways
that would have required hours of painful bus riding, and that is what I
would really like to highlight in this post.</p>
<h2 id="dingli-cliffs">Dingli Cliffs</h2>
<p>Our first outing in the car was to the Dingli Cliffs. As spectacular as
they are from the shore, we can&rsquo;t wait for warmer weather so that we
can experience the cliffs from the water side. You just don&rsquo;t get the
scale from pictures but these cliffs are 250 meters. Straight down.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f1b779a8a4.jpg" alt="The Dingli Cliffs. Yes, thats me."></p>
<p>We arrived in the morning, just after the rain had stopped. So although
we knew we were in the right place we were well ahead of the rest of the
tourists and hikers for the day. After a couple of long dead ends that
led to some nice scenery, we hit the jackpot and were rewarded with some
spectacular views.</p>
<p>After hiking the cliffs, we continued south to check out the Blue
Grotto. Again, a bit of hiking away from the normal tourist crowd left
us alone with plenty of time to just take in the sites. We had yet to
actually find the Blue Grotto, but after we returned to the car, we were
informed by the local captain that he was the parking lot guard for the
day. He said this as he extended his hand with palm up, ready to accept
a euro coin from us. We were not sure exactly what his duties were, but
he told us where we should go to get a good view.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/6767b2c1c7.jpg" alt="The Blue Grotto with the small island of Filfla in thebackground."></p>
<p>The little island in the picture is called Filfla and it looks like an
aircraft carrier. So it was used for target practice by the British air
force during world war II.</p>
<h2 id="golden-bay">Golden Bay</h2>
<p>Another weekend, and another short car trip. Remember that Malta is only
122 Square Miles. So we never have that far to drive. This time toward
the Northwest side of the island where there are a series of bays, the
most famous of which is called Golden Bay.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-{=html}" data-lang="{=html}">&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m10!1m8!1m3!1d12922.867375123567!2d14.34252!3d35.9294303!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!5e0!3m2!1sen!2s!4v1426599232753&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;border:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</code></pre><p>This bay actually called Ghajn Tuffieha, was the site of the incident
with the sprained ankle. All I can say is that after seeing the place in
person, I&rsquo;m glad they called the ambulance. I can&rsquo;t imagine trying to
carry a person with a sprained ankle across the rocks, then the beach,
then up all of those stairs!</p>
<p>The weather was great and the scenery was spectacular. We just walked
slowly and took in all of the great sights. In the distance we could see
the sheer cliffs of the southwest side of Gozo. The water is so
unbelievably clear that you can see the bottom of this bay from the top
of the cliffs. Its not terribly deep but at least 12 meters we are told.
Now that is some visibility. It definitely motivates us to want to dust
off our SCUBA diving skills again before we leave the island.</p>
<h2 id="marsaxlokk">Marsaxlokk</h2>
<p>This last Sunday we took a morning drive to Marsaxlokk (pron.
Marsa-Schlock). This is a smallish fishing town at the very south of the
island. On Sunday mornings they have a great farmers market with fresh
produce and tons of fresh seafood. We ended up at a stall where the lady
was nice enough to educate us a bit about finding fresh fish. I was
pretty sure she was being truthful with us as there was a chef from a
restaurant also at the table getting fish for his restaurant. Clear
eyes, red gills. The clear eyes thing is a bit subjective, but the Sea
Bass we bought was Amazing. After a couple of youtube videos on how to
fillet the thing (thankfully our fishmonger gutted it for us) we had
some nice fillets for Sunday lunch.</p>
<p>There is a nice looking fish market on the way home from the university
that I will not hesitate to try in the near future. I think some nice
King Prawns and risotto is on the way to our table soon.</p>
<p>Where we go from here with respect to the car is an unknown. It goes
back next Monday, and I think Jane and I will both breathe a sigh of
relief. Although once we get back from spring break we will not have too
many weekends left on the island, I think we may take advantage of a one
or two day rental to continue to get out of Sliema and enjoy the open
spaces of Malta.</p>

<p>The first thing you notice when you get to the Cirkewwa ferry terminal
is how close you are to Comino and Gozo. All this talk of using EU funds
to build a bride, doesn&rsquo;t seem that far fetched. One hop to Comino,
another to Gozo. Nevertheless the short ferry ride gives you time to
anticipate the day ahead. After weeks of cool and rain we had a
fantastic weather day to visit the island.</p>
<p>I was trying out the <em>GeoTag Photos</em> app for the trip, that would use
the gps in my iPhone to track our movement around the island. Later you
upload the gps data and sync it with your photos. Since my camera
doesn&rsquo;t have a built in GPS, this works well for adding location data
to your photos. It worked great, and you can even use the data you
capture to build a map of your day.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/2b2d9825a0.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>We hired a van and a guide for this day because we wanted to cover a lot
of ground. You can get everywhere on public buses but you end up
spending half your day waiting around bus stops. It is also a law on
Malta that at many of the outdoor attractions groups of 10 or more must
be accompanied by a licensed guide. So, our guide, Joseph, met us at the
ferry terminal on Gozo and we were off on our whirlwind tour. Now you
may think that this was quite a marathon day but you have to know that
Gozo is only 8.7 miles long and 4.5 miles wide.</p>
<p>Our first stop was Ramla bay, a red-sand beach and lots of green space.
Yes, glorious, fabulous, wide open space free from limestone buildings
and paved roads. Over the course of the day it became very clear to me
that this is exactly what I have been missing, and I&rsquo;m really coming to
understand that although there are things I like about the city I am
really a small town guy at heart.</p>
<p>After some time of watching the students cavorting on the beach we moved
on to Calypso cave, where we had a great view of the underwater sea wall
built by the Knights of St. John as part of the islands protection
against the Turks. You can see the wall, closer to shore than you might
think pretty clearly in the picture.</p>

<p>From the bay we headed to the Megalithic temples at Ä gantija that date
to Neolithic times. We had heard a lot about these temples in our
History lecture and so it was great to visit and see these massive
structures first hand. They truly are massive. There are some hints
about how the giant slabs were moved around, in that they have hundreds
of stone balls that have been discovered. The theory is that the balls
were used like bearings and the slabs were rolled on top of the balls.
Pretty clever for 5000BC if you ask me.</p>
<p>From the temples we made short stop at the salt flats in Marsalforn. It
was only a five minute stop but is definitely on the list to return to.
I managed to purchase a bag of sea salt from the guy who owns the salt
flats, and so I should be set with some great salt for cooking the rest
of our time here in Malta.</p>
<p>Next was a stop in Victoria for a quick slice of pizza as we walked to
the Citadel. Today was really about great outdoor scenery, but I include
one shot of the citadel. Bonus points to anyone who can spot the problem
in this photo.</p>
<p>The highlight of the day was the Azure Window. This is nearly iconic
place for Malta, and it certainly lives up to all expectations. What I
wasn&rsquo;t expecting was the awesome little boat ride from the inland sea
to the Azure Window. You start out in this little bit of inland water,
and the boat takes you through a tunnel out into the mediterranean sea,
into a few caves and finally under the big arch that forms the window.
It was so beautiful and I can&rsquo;t wait to get back to Gozo again to visit
this place. You could easily spend half a day hiking around and on top
of the arch.</p>
<p>Our final stop, and another highlight is the town of Xlendi (pronounced
shlendee). The first thing I said to our guide was that I felt like I
had just driven into Cinque Terre, and he agreed. This is a beautiful
blue bay, with lots of space for hiking and enjoying the outdoors.</p>
<p>Although there were a lot of places that needed more time, the trip was
a real success in that we got a great taste of all the places we want to
revisit.</p>

			 <h1 id="i-want-to-be-an-archeologist">I Want to be an Archeologist</h1>
<p>I think I might want to be an archeologist when I grow up. In the last
week we&rsquo;ve had four lectures involving geology, geography, and
archeology here in Malta. All of them have been fascinating along
multiple dimensions. It has been such a positive part of our Malta
experience that I wanted to write my thoughts down right away. To give
you a clue where this ultimately rather long post is going let me tell
you what I find so interesting up front.</p>
<ol>
<li>Observing some really good professors do their thing.</li>
<li>Getting to be a student again.</li>
<li>Learning how other fields do problem solving as good as CS.</li>
<li>Understanding what the phrase &ldquo;learning in place&rdquo; is all about.</li>
</ol>
<p>First, its been really fun for me as a professor to observe other
professors doing their thing. I know that we are really privileged to be
getting some of the best in their field to speak to us. But they are all
really passionate about their topics and it is amazing to me how that
passion comes through. I honestly walked out of today&rsquo;s lecture with
Professor Vella and said to Jane: &ldquo;I want to be an archeologist when I
grow up.&rdquo; She may or may not have said that &ldquo;I would never grow up,&rdquo;
so there was nothing to worry about. Then one of the students mentioned
something about archeologists living in tents for long periods of time
and that further tempered my enthusiasm.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/946e6145fa.jpg" alt="Hypogeum Ä¦al Saflieni (Malta), the sanctuary chamber Holy of HoliesHypogeum Ä¦al Saflieni (Malta) built 6,000 years ago. ImageCC-by-SA"></p>
<p>Second, its really nice to attend class as a student. I&rsquo;m sitting in on
our History course called &ldquo;Malta and the Maltese -- A Historical and
Cultural Review,&rdquo; and of course I&rsquo;m attending our Paideia II course on
&ldquo;Ethics and Current issues in Malta.&rdquo; I have to evaluate the student
for this one. Most of the content of the courses I&rsquo;m attending, I know
absolutely nothing about. But I can&rsquo;t even tell you the number of times
during our lectures that I&rsquo;ve had that little tingle of excitement at
the base of my neck. I feel like the poster child for &ldquo;lifelong
learning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Third, in my own myopic way, I assumed that computer science, and some
of the other sciences had a monopoly on problem solving. It turns out
that archeologists solve some pretty interesting problems too. And they
use some of the same techniques as the computer scientists. Or maybe its
the other way around. To be fair the closest I&rsquo;ve come to an archeology
class is Indiana Jones.</p>
<p>Of course problem solving starts with a problem or a question, such as:
How do we know that the so called megalithic temples were really
temples? Why is metal better than stone? What can we learn from contents
of the cargo hold of the Ulu Burun? As our lecturer said, I have a
colleague who knows everything there is to know about this pot, its
chemical composition, every marking and scratch. Meh. Who used this pot?
What did they use it for? Who did they use it with? These are the
important questions. Now the chemical composition may be important in
helping us answer those questions. But we cannot stop with that. In fact
it was chemical analysis that showed that of the four sites where
obsidian could have come to Malta only two of the sites matched the
chemical fingerprints of the obsidian on Malta. Which tells us more
about who the people were that were coming to the island at that time.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/32f9cfa566.jpg" alt="The Tarxien Temples are examples of Megalithic structures which areamong the oldest in the world."></p>
<p>In our history class we have heard much about the importance of Malta
through the ages because of its location on the routes into and out of
the Mediterranean. For the most part people have assumed that ancient
sailors tacked their way through the Straight of Malta against the
prevailing winds. It turns out that would not work well at all. In fact
ancient square rigged sailboats could not even tack that way! So sailors
probably made for Sicily, then south and around the island of Malta and
maybe even further south around Lampadusa and then worked their way
west. But you have to know a bit about sailing and ancient boat design
in order to figure this out. I love how this incorporates techniques
from lots of different branches of the academy.</p>
<p>Finally, The faculty of Luther College received an email from our
assistant dean, Jeff Wilkerson, the other day inviting us to a
discussion about &ldquo;learning in-place.&rdquo; I will have to respectfully
decline, but I think that is exactly what we are doing here in Malta!
There is something really compelling about our lectures when everything
we are talking about is within about an hours drive on public
transportation. We can learn some theory about the Megalithic Temples,
and now I&rsquo;m much more interested in taking the time to actually go see
them. It feels like the entire island is our classroom.</p>
<p>Everyday on the news we hear about the migrant crisis in Malta and
Italy. People from Syria and Somalia are fleeing their countries in fear
of their lives. They are coming by the hundreds of thousands and
overloading the ability of the Italian and Maltese governments to handle
them. We have seen why this cannot be an easy decision for them, as many
of the people who flee across the mediterranean in these boats die in
the process. Three evenings a week, our students come face to face with
people who have made this journey and survived. Most are the same age as
our students. Only the young and strong can survive the journey.</p>
<p>Just think about that. How many of our Luther Students have truly had to
risk their lives. How many of us in the Luther community even understand
what it means to live under the threat of death? This is one part of
living abroad that makes me very grateful for the security, relative
safety, and freedom we have in our country.</p>
<p>Our students travel to the Hal Far detention center to work with the
residents who want to learn english or to improve their english skills,
so that they can leave the Hal Far center, find a job, and ultimately
apply for citizenship somewhere in the EU.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/fd3624512a.jpg" alt="A personal pet peeve of mine."></p>
<p>Here is one more example, that I find particularly interesting because
it gets at one of my pet peeves about where we live in Malta. In a
lecture on sustainability we were told that because of their colonial
past the primary moral frame of reference for the Maltese is the
<em>family</em> not the <em>community</em>. This is interesting, especially for those
of us who think that community is a nearly sacred word on the Luther
campus. But what does it mean to have a moral frame of reference
centered around family? Do we see evidence that it is true? We are told
that because the moral frame of reference is the family and not the
community there is not a highly developed sense of citizenship or
emphasis on &ldquo;the greater good&rdquo; here in Malta. We see this in the
streets every day in the form of litter, and even worse dog poo casually
left on the sidewalk by all sorts of people. People take very good care
of their homes on the inside, but the public areas of the city are not
treated with respect. One has to get used to looking up and down as you
walk on the narrow sidewalks here. Down for the aforementioned reason,
and up, because in many places there are drain pipes from overhanging
decks that drain the water onto your head! We see further evidence of
this idea as we hear about the myriad of government programs that are
started, but never fully supported by the people, and therefore
abandoned. On the flip side of this, the Maltese people are justifiably
very proud of their country and its amazing history. We&rsquo;ve been told
more than once that most Maltese think their country is the best thing
ever.</p>
<p>Of course, I&rsquo;m still a newcomer here, and I&rsquo;m not a social scientist,
so I may be interpreting things all wrong. If I am, then I would be
happy to have further conversation to understand better. For example,
some of the issues in Sliema may simply be due to the large number of
international people who are living here either on holiday, or as long
term residents. I also know that I am generalizing, which is always
dangerous. Just like any place I know there are Maltese who do not
litter and care deeply for the environment, and work tirelessly to
improve the island. I&rsquo;m sure there are people who pick up after their
dogs. Although I&rsquo;m less sure about the latter than the former. There
are lots of people who volunteer their time through NGOs. I&rsquo;m sure it
takes years to leave the laissez-faire attitude in the past. After all,
Malta only gained independence in 1964, and statehood in 1974. After
thousands of years of being conquered by almost everyone else, 50 years
of self rule is hardly any time at all. I can imagine that after an
entire history of being ruled by others, it would be easy to let
external things slide and to focus inward.</p>
<p>I wish I could travel forward in time a thousand years to see what the
archeologists of 4015 have to say about Malta in 2015. In the meantime,
I know that I will enjoy the next three months and all that I will learn
in that time.</p>

			 <h1 id="adventures-of-an-expat-cord-cutter">Adventures of an Expat Cord Cutter</h1>
<p>Even thought I&rsquo;m living abroad and traveling for an extended period
there are a few entertaining parts of my life I&rsquo;m not willing to leave
behind. Watching Arsenal, keeping up with The Big Bang Theory, The
Blacklist, Food Network, and a few others. How you do this is well
covered territory. You can probably figure it out with several google
searches, but it seems worth it to collect my own efforts into one
cohesive post. Here are the problems to solve:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to stream TV shows that have geographic restrictions. Lots of
content is available only inside the borders of the USA.</li>
<li>How to get the content off of your small screen and onto a larger
screen if you are lucky enough to have one.</li>
<li>How to optimize your WiFi and streaming throughput in the midst of
an urban WiFi jungle.</li>
</ol>
<p>Warning. This is a geeky technical post. You can quit here and I won&rsquo;t
feel bad.</p>
<h2 id="streaming">Streaming</h2>
<p>There are lots of options for streaming from places like Hulu, Netflix,
and even the big four major networks all have apps now that let you
stream more or less of their content. When we left home, I had
NBCSportsLive Extra, Netflix, HBO Go, DirectTV all installed on my iPad.
I also have iTunes, and had downloaded a few movies that I had on my
list to watch. In the United States this would be fine, but all of these
apps (except iTunes) have geographic restrictions on them. So I also had
to subscribe to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) service and configure
that on my iPad.</p>
<h3 id="vpn">VPN</h3>
<p>If you are not familiar with a VPN you can think of it as a bit of
software that messes around with your network configuration to make the
rest of your computer and the rest of the world think that you are a
part of some other network. This is often used in large organizations
where you have content that you restrict to your own institutional
network. Luther does this with some resources, like our network drives.
Other services, such as O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Safari, may check to make sure that
you are coming from a particular network before you are granted access
to their own content because of a corporate licensing agreement. If you
have a VPN connection back to your institutional network then it is just
like you are in the office and not at home or halfway around the world.</p>
<p>Now the reason this is important for my entertainment is that there are
many VPN services that exist partly for the purpose of making it look
like you are connected to a network in the United States somewhere
rather than a network in Vietnam or Malta. I signed up with <a href="http://www.privteinternetaccess.com">Private
Internet Access</a> These services
also have the side effect that your content is encrypted from the time
it leaves your computer until it leaves the VPN provider, which many
people look at as a significant privacy benefit. Using a VPN to trick
NBC into thinking that I am in the united states might be considered a
moral gray area, but I&rsquo;m still paying my DirecTV, and Mediacom bill
every month back home every month so I don&rsquo;t have any problem going to
sleep.</p>
<p>The VPN solution works pretty well, except for some content providers
have figured out how to identify these VPN servers, and have made moves
to block the connections from known VPN providers. I&rsquo;m looking at you
ABC.</p>
<p>This content blocking thing is interesting, especially from companies
like ABC that force you to watch commercials as part of their streamed
offering. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they want more eyeballs on their commercials?</p>
<h2 id="to-the-big-screen">To the Big Screen</h2>
<p>Once we got settled in our flat in Malta, I decided I wanted to upgrade
the streaming experience by adding an AppleTV to the TV in our flat.
With this setup, I can use Airplay to send the content from my iPad to
the larger screen we had set up in our living area. Except that it
doesn&rsquo;t work. The AppleTV has no provision for joining a VPN. There are
some ugly hacks that involve jailbreaking your AppleTV but I didn&rsquo;t
want to go there. I&rsquo;d rather install more iPad apps for streaming
FoodTV, Fox Sports, and several others that I&rsquo;ve added to the list
since we arrived.</p>
<p>Here is our Entertainment center in our flat in Sliema.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/50f5b94cb6.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<h3 id="dns">DNS</h3>
<p>The Domain Name Service is at the heart of the Internet. If you haven&rsquo;t
been subjected to my days of DNS in Networking class, you can think of
it like a phone book for the entire world. Of course its way more fun
and complicated than that.</p>
<p>So what does DNS have to do with this particular problem? Well, when you
want to contact a website or stream some video, you need to look up the
address of the server that authenticates you, <strong>and</strong> checks to see that
that address is in the right country. You find the address by contacting
your friendly local DNS server. You normally don&rsquo;t have to worry about
this because your home router takes care of it. But, it is an easy thing
to customize. It turns out that these video streaming services use one
server for authentication, and a different server for video streaming.</p>
<p>With me so far? Now there are companies that provide DNS services to
replace the DNS provided by your friendly neighborhood Internet Service
Provider. For example Google runs DNS servers that you can use. They are
really reliable, and of course keep track of all the addresses you look
up to better inform their search algorithms I suppose. However, if
google wasn&rsquo;t trustworthy, you could ask them for the address of
company X, and they could lie to you so you connected to company Y.</p>
<p>In order to avoid a full VPN, and to make it easier for helping iPads,
iPhones, and AppleTVs get around the geographical restrictions there are
some companies that are running their own DNS servers that will in fact
lie to you about the server you connect to for the authentication part
of setting up a video stream. This little setup is actually called a
<strong>proxy.</strong> So when you ask for the address of the ABC authentication
server you don&rsquo;t connect to ABC you connect to one of the servers run
by <a href="http://www.unotelly.com">UnoTelly</a>. UnoTelly sits between you and
the authentication server and passes on your information. But since the
UnoTelly server is in the United State, ABC thinks you are in the United
States too. With the authentication taken care of UnoTelly gets out of
the way and allows your AppleTV to connect directly to the streaming
server. So far the UnoTelly servers remain blissfully below the radar of
content providers everywhere. Yay technology. Also, DNS is very easy to
customize even on your AppleTV.</p>
<p>This is a silly arms race between the VPN Providers, the DNS providers,
and the content providers. Hopefully this will sort itself out in a
saner fashion sometime soon. In the meantime its likely that every time
the content providers find one way to block some clever software
engineer will figure out a way around the block. It reminds of of disk
copy protection software in my younger days. No matter what scheme a
software company came up with to block copying, someone would figure out
a way around it.</p>
<h2 id="optimizing-your-streaming">Optimizing your Streaming</h2>
<p>Which brings us to our final problem. How to optimize your streaming in
the WiFi jungle. The flat we live in is in a very densely populated
area. My WiFi Scanner program shows between 15 and 20 different access
points depending on the time of day and day of the week. With this many
access points there is a lot of interference because everyone is trying
to use a rather narrow band of the radio spectrum at the same time.
Although WiFi is divided up into 11 different channels, there are really
only 3 of the channels that don&rsquo;t overlap and interfere with nearby
channels.</p>
<p>So the best solution is actually to use wired internet if you can.
luckily my AppleTV and my Router sit right next to each other, so its
easy to plug in. Even when I am using Airplay from my iPad to send
something to the AppleTV the stream ends up coming directly through the
wire rather than over WiFi.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t plug in, then you might think that the thing to do is to
choose a channel that isn&rsquo;t being used by one of your neighbors. It
turns out that most routers use channel 1 or 6 or 11 by default. So your
first thought might be to use 2 or 5. But that will actually make the
problem worse, because 1 and 2 will be unaware of each other and just
make interference. The counter intuitive solution is to pick the same
channel as your neighbor with the strongest signal. This way the normal
Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)
algorithm can actually do its work. Yep, CSMA/CA is another day of
networking class, but now you can throw that around like your an expert
the next time someone brings up WiFi.</p>
<p>So with all of this, we have a pretty good setup. I can catch up on
shows on all of the major networks, I can stream English Premier League
Football, and FA cup, and Champions league. I can watch FoodTV, and of
course we can watch anything that is on the AppleTV. Just last night we
finally got around to watching the Theory of Everything. Of course some
times are better than others, and some providers are better than others.
AppleTV is top notch all the time. I always get a good stream on
anything I watch on any of the apps on the AppleTV. Sadly its the sports
streaming FoxGo, and NBCSports Live Extra, that seem to fall down. I
don&rsquo;t know if they are not built out enough to handle the worldwide
demand, or what the deal is. But there is a lot of season left, so I
hope they keep on improving.</p>
<p>When I get back home I probably will not remain a cord cutter. Too much
content still relies on me having my DirecTV password to show that I am
paying for it. To often, I have to play technical support person in the
middle of a show to restart the stream. But it does make me wonder about
our lake house. Do we really need two DirecTV subscriptions, especially
for the amount of time we spend watching TV there, and with our Fiber
Optic connection just around the corner, the bandwidth we&rsquo;ll have for
streaming in the middle of Wisconsin lake country will be quite amazing.</p>

<p>After a cold morning of touring the colliseum and other ancient roman
ruins, we had the chance to meet the Maltese ambassador to Rome, Vanessa
Frazier. She happens to be a Luther alum, and was extremely gracious in
receiving us and telling us some great stories. I think it is always
really valuable for Luther students to hear the pathways that alumni
take after leaving Decorah.</p>
<p>Here is the group, pictured with our guide Nino. We all loved him and
will always remember the phrase &ldquo;Nino is here&rdquo; as it sounded inside
our earbuds that constantly linked us to Nino. Yes, Nino really does
have his own website called <a href="http://www.ninoknows.com">Nino Knows</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/54c7d1b275.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>One interesting story from the ambassador involved teaching a certain
beloved Luther professor how to say &ldquo;good morning&rdquo; in Maltese. The
prof cheerfully greeted her the rest of her days at Luther with that
little bit of Malta. Only she didn&rsquo;t really teach him to say good
morning. The next time you see Uwe you&rsquo;ll have to ask him what she
really taught him to say! I can&rsquo;t wait to see hime when I get back to
hear his side of the story.</p>
<p>When we asked her what an ambassador does on an average day she told us
the following story, which I love, because it gets to the heart of what
everyone needs to do to be successful in their career. She said that on
her first day in the foreign service an older, wiser colleague told her
that on the first day she needed to go into the streets and find a
butcher, and talk to the butcher about meat. On the second day she
needed to go into the streets and find a baker and talk about bread. On
the third day she needed to go into the streets and talk to the people
about sandwiches.</p>
<p>In the end its about networking and making connections. This is what
everyone needs to do to be successful. Make connections with people,
learn how you can help them, and how they can help you. You will get
much farther if you have a network that can collectively solve problems
together.</p>

<p>Ostia is about a half hour train ride away from the center of Rome, back
in the direction of the airport and the coast. In fact Ostia was the
port for Rome in ancient times, until it fell out of favor. Slowly the
city became covered with silt from the river until it was buried and
forgotten. The layers of silt have preserved the city very much like the
ash from the volcano preserved Pompeii. We had no formal guide this day,
but it was still fun, to just walk and imagine yourself in that place in
ancient times.</p>

<h2 id="the-vatican">The Vatican</h2>
<p>Hiding behind the ancient dirty exteriors of the buildings of the old
city of Rome are beautiful palaces, with works of art as beautiful as
those in the Vatican Museum. We Romans know how to live! So says Nino,
our guide for our day at the Vatican. He is right too, when you walk
around at night, and look into the windows of some of the places you
see, you will notice that although the exteriors look pretty shabby, the
interiors are very beautiful.</p>
<p>Having a guide is really the only way to go when visiting the vatican,
otherwise you just wander around aimlessly looking at stuff without
knowing the story behind all of the amazing things you see.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been drawn to this photo on the ceiling of the first of the
Raphael rooms, wondering what it was all about. The title really tells
you all you need to know. <em>The Triumph of Christianity.</em> The fresco was
commissioned by Pope Gregory XII in 1582.</p>

<p>After the Vatican we turned the students loose for some time on their
own. Jane and I went out in search of a restaurant. We, of course, had a
couple in mind that Jane had researched prior to the trip. However that
all went out the window when we were standing outside a pub only to see
Ãzil score a goal for Arsenal against Tottenham. Now we were sucked in.
Reviews aside, we were right across from the Vatican at what would
surely be expensive, but there was football to watch. So into the Ris
Cafe we went. Since many patrons were there getting lunch before the
Italy Ireland Rugby match there were no tables available, so we agreed
that as long as we could see the game sitting at the bar was fine. Soon
a table opened up. But it had a horrible view of the game. So the
manager asked the couple sitting at a different table to move to our
table so we could have a better view. It was, but only marginally. We
had just sat down and started to look at the menus when he came back and
announced he had a better table for us in the other room. So we moved
again. This time we had a great view of the game at a really nice table.
Perfect. We were settled in and enjoying a pint of beer and the game.
Ten minutes later the manager appeared again with a grin, and said &ldquo;now
you have to go back to the bar!&rdquo; He started laughing, and we knew he
was just having some fun with us. Sadly, the evil Tottenham Hotspurs
outscored the Arsenal in the second half. Even more sadly, was that with
four minutes left in the game, they changed the channel! The Ireland
versus Italy rugby match was starting, and I believe we were the only
people in the bar who cared one bit about Arsenal at that point!</p>

			 <h1 id="acclimating">Acclimating</h1>
<p>A confession: I like my creature comforts. I like my nice modern home
with in-floor heating and its &ldquo;open concept&rdquo; design. I like my big
screen TV. I like my big kitchen with my fancy range, large
refrigerator. I like things that are new and clean. I think that is part
of what attracted to me to computer science.</p>
<p>When we were traveling in emerging economy countries like Vietnam or
Cambodia we always knew that no matter what we saw during the day, we
would return to our five star hotel in the evening and have all of the
comforts of home. We saw some very poor living conditions in some of the
places we visited, and I&rsquo;m working on writing up a post about that, and
what Jane and I took away from that experience.</p>
<p>But now we have moved into our flat in Malta, a developed country, with
an advanced economy according the IMF. Yet, things feel very different
and its going to take a while to acclimate. Moving in to a new country
was always part of the excitement of taking on the directorship of the
Malta program. The point was that we would get to settle in, and
actually live in a place outside of the U.S. for an extended period of
time. We are both excited about this opportunity.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I thought it would be interesting to note some of the
things that stand out right now, in the first week or so, and then
revisit this at the end of our time in Malta. I hope what I write in the
coming paragraphs will not be construed as overly negative. I&rsquo;m not
judging, just trying to record my feelings and observations as we get
used to a new place.</p>
<h2 id="living-arrangements">Living Arrangements</h2>
<p>Yes, we are on a mediterranean island, but they have winter too. The
highs have been in the mid fifties. We have had some rain each day, and
a bit of wind. The winters are short, and we are told that the
temperatures will begin to climb again at the end of February. Hurray!
The views of the ocean are everywhere, and they are beautiful. I can&rsquo;t
wait for a bit warmer weather to take more pictures of the boats in all
the little harbors.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9cb129fc5d.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>In the meantime, we are learning how to stay warm in a big stone
building. We have no heating other than a little oil filled electric
radiator, and an electric blanket on our bed at night. I SO want to go
out and buy a big old 20,000 BTU gas powered heater and set it up in our
hallway, but I think that will not happen. We are learning that running
the dehumidifiers is important. Dryer air feels warmer. We dress in
layers, and use blankets while relaxing in the evening. The chill has
been the hardest thing to get used to in our first week. I hate being
cold, and knowing that I&rsquo;m here until June keeps me from finding a nice
warm hotel room. We did join the health club at the Meridian Hotel, a
few blocks away. The membership ensures us a nice place to work out, and
a shower with LOTS of hot water. They also have a jacuzzi and a heated
indoor pool that we can soak in to warm ourselves the evenings.</p>
<p>The odd thing is that in the daytime it is nicer outside than inside. So
yesterday we had a nice lunch on the roof in the sunshine and it was
very nice.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9d9142167e.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<h2 id="getting-around">Getting around</h2>
<p>We have no car. We have no bike. We have no scooter. So we walk, and
walk, and walk. When we arrive at our building we climb 3 flights of
stairs to get to our flat. Walking is good, but with all the hills my
shins really suffered the first couple of days. They are getting better
now. We are also learning the bus system for the longer trips. But
really the island is not that big and we can walk almost anywhere to get
what we need. We are told that the Maltese would be appalled, as they
will drive their cars two blocks to the store rather than walk.</p>
<p>They have people to clean the streets and sidewalks regularly, but its
amazing what litterbugs people are around here. And many people let
their dogs poop on the sidewalk!! They just leave it there for the
sidewalk cleaner to pick up later. Watch your step as you are walking.
You have to be alert to many things while you are walking. First the
sidewalks in most places are so narrow that you can&rsquo;t really walk side
by side. If you meet someone, chances are one of you is going to step
out into the street. You just better hope one of the drivers doesn&rsquo;t
choose that moment to get the carbon out of their car and come roaring
around a corner at you. Most of the streets are one way, and are only
wide enough for one lane of traffic. I&rsquo;ve talked to several people now
about getting a bike and they have all strongly advised me against it!</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/58d80035e0.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<h2 id="the-people">The People</h2>
<p>We have been very fortunate to be welcomed to the island by some Luther
alumni, both Maltese and American expats. This has been really nice. We
haven&rsquo;t really met many people in the neighborhood yet, but we have only
been here a few days, so we surely look like we are just short term
visitors to most people. The owner of the Ironmongery (a hardware store)
was super nice to me today when I stopped by to purchase a gas grill for
the roof. The people at the University have been very welcoming, and we
have a long list of helpful advice and things to check out. We are
looking forward to meeting more new people and reconnecting with Luther
classmates who have come back to the island.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to speak english very well, and in fact english is the
co-official language of Malta. However, most everyone we have run into
seems to prefer to speak in Maltese. I assumed that it was probably a
derivative of italian, since that is what it partially sounded like to
my American ears, but in fact it is Siculo-Arabic. About half the
vocabulary is standard italian, and 20% of the vocabulary is english,
with the rest coming from this Sicilian Arabic dialect.</p>
<h2 id="shopping">Shopping</h2>
<p>There is nothing like a Target, or Walmart on the island. You do all
your shopping at small neighborhood stores. If you need pharmaceuticals
you go to the pharmacy on the corner. If you need a grill you go to the
ironmongery on the other corner. If you need electronics you go to the
electronics store. If you need wine, you can go, well, almost anywhere.
Seriously, there are all kinds of little wine shops on every street. I
honestly don&rsquo;t know how they stay in business, from my own observations
they don&rsquo;t move a huge volume of wine in a day.</p>
<p>I kind of like this way of shopping. Its like we do back home for
groceries, the coop for this, and Fareway for that, etc. However, back
home I don&rsquo;t hesitate to order from Amazon. Sadly, my Amazon Prime
membership does not cover me here in Malta.</p>
<p>Another little thing to get used to is that most shops close up shortly
after noon, and stay closed for an hour or two or three. Then they are
open again until about 7 p.m.</p>
<h2 id="eating">Eating</h2>
<p>Of course I saved my favorite topic until last. There is a wide variety
of restaurants within walking distance of the flat. Great Pizza at
Piccolo Padre is just a couple blocks away. Fish and Chips at the
Scotsman Pub is a bit further, but appears to be a good place to watch
EPL football, as does the Balluta bar just down the street, but we
haven&rsquo;t tried that place yet. Vecchia Napoli is another close by
Italian place. We had lunch there the other day and found out that we
had to sit outside under a heater since we had not reserved an indoor
seat in advance! For lunch! We are trying to balance our eating habits
so that we cook either lunch or dinner at home, and then try out a
variety of eating places opposite. I&rsquo;ll leave this post with my
favorite discovery... I can buy an entire kilo of Parmigiano Reggiano
for just 19 euros! I may need another suitcase to bring home my cheese!</p>
<p>We are generally late eaters back home. I don&rsquo;t usually start cooking
until around 6 p.m. But we are quickly learning that the dinner hour in
Malta is very Mediterranean. Most places don&rsquo;t even open for dinner
until 7 or 7:30p.m. With the busy time coming around 9. Similarly, lunch
time is also later with people eating at around 1 p.m.</p>

<p>After a short morning flight from Siem Reap, we arrived in Bangkok, for
what seems a bit more like an extended layover than an actual stop on
our trip. We leave for Malta in a few hours at 1:05 a.m. For our last
night of our Asian adventure we are staying at the Oriental Residence in
Bangkok. We are on the 19th floor, and this is our view of the city.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7f2452ac36.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>|</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/d9441c9c50.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>We had two very nice guides for yesterday afternoon and today. We
visited the grand palace of the king, the summer palace, and a whole
bunch of temples. The architecture of the Thai temples is different and
interesting, and our guide yesterday filled in some gaps in our
knowledge of Buddhism. In Bangkok, you can see temples built using a
Thai architecture, Khmer architecture, and even a few Mosques. We saw
temples within temples. We have lost count. I think it is safe to say
that we are now &ldquo;templed out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bangkok itself is very different from anything we have seen in Vietnam
and Cambodia. It is definitely a large modern city. Complete with
massive traffic jams and loads of tourists. The food has been excellent.
Green Curry, Massaman Curry, Tom Yum soup. Today out on the river we had
the Tom Yum Goong (with prawns) and we told our guide to order it Thai
style for us rather than &ldquo;foreigner style.&rdquo; Well, let me tell you, we
like our food spicy but I lost my voice after a spoonful of this!! Oh My
it was hot. We also had a chicken and basil stir fry that was absolutely
delicious. How you can make something stir fried taste so spicy and like
it just came off the grill, I don&rsquo;t know. But I&rsquo;m definitely going to
be working on it. We have a few bags of spices in our luggage that I
hope make it through immigration in Malta.</p>
<p>It is now time to start a new chapter of this journey and we are both
looking forward to arriving in Malta in about 25 hours.</p>
<p>P.S. I hope the song gets stuck in your head for a day too. And just in
case, you can&rsquo;t remember, I&rsquo;m not sure I ever really knew them all.
But here are the lyrics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bangkok, Oriental setting And the city don&rsquo;t know what the city is
getting The creme de la creme of the chess world In a show with
everything but Yul Brynner</p>
<p>Time flies, doesn&rsquo;t seem a minute Since the Tirolean Spa had the
chess boys in it All change, don&rsquo;t you know that when you Play at
this level, there&rsquo;s no ordinary venue</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s Iceland or the Philippines Or Hastings or, or this place</p>
<p>One night in Bangkok and the world&rsquo;s your oyster The bars are temples
but the pearls ain&rsquo;t free You&rsquo;ll find a God in every golden cloister
And if you&rsquo;re lucky then the God&rsquo;s a she I can feel an angel sliding
up to me</p>
<p>One town&rsquo;s very like another When your head&rsquo;s down over your pieces,
Brother</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a drag, it&rsquo;s a bore, it&rsquo;s really such a pity To be looking at
the board, not looking at the city</p>
<p>Whaddya mean? Ya seen one crowded, polluted, stinking town</p>
<p>Tea girls, warm and sweet, warm, sweet Some are set up in the Somerset
Maugham Suite</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get Thai&rsquo;d&rdquo;, you&rsquo;re talking to a tourist Whose every move&rsquo;s
among the purest I get my kicks above the waistline, sunshine</p>
<p>One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble Not much between despair
and ecstasy One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble Can&rsquo;t be
too careful with your company I can feel the Devil walking next to me</p>
<p>Siam&rsquo;s gonna be the witness To the ultimate test of cerebral fitness
This grips me more than would A muddy old river or Reclining Buddha</p>
<p>But thank God, I&rsquo;m only watching the game, controlling it</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see you guys rating The kind of mate I&rsquo;m contemplating I&rsquo;d
let you watch, I would invite you But the queens we use would not
excite you</p>
<p>So you better go back to your bars, your temples Your massage parlors</p>
<p>One night in Bangkok and the world&rsquo;s your oyster The bars are temples
but the pearls ain&rsquo;t free You&rsquo;ll find a God in every golden cloister
A little flesh, a little history I can feel an angel slidin' up to me</p>
<p>One night in Bangkok makes a hard man humble Not much between despair
and ecstasy One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble Can&rsquo;t be
too careful with your company I can feel the Devil walking next to me</p>
<p>-- Murray Head</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok fun fact about this song: Along with the rest of the songs from
Chess, the music was written by BjÃ¶rn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of
ABBA, and Tim Rice wrote the lyrics. Can you feel the love tonight?</p>

<p>Today was another one of those days that was thought-provoking,
uplifting, and inspiring. This morning we had a new guide, who took us
to his own village and showed us his own house. That experience will be
a part of a post that has been brewing for a week or so. I&rsquo;m going to
do this one first as it is fresh in my mind.</p>
<p>We just got back from JWOC (yes, they pronounce it jay walk) which
stands for <a href="http://www.journeyswithinourcommunity.org/about/">Journeys Within Our
Community</a>. What a
great experience! We didn&rsquo;t really know a lot about what we were in for
this afternoon, other than we were there to volunteer in a class, and it
would involve speaking english. So far, so good.</p>
<p>Before I tell you about the class, and what we did, I want to give you a
little background about JWOC and the educational system here in
Cambodia. The latter is easy. Its pretty minimal. Students <em>may</em> go to
school from ages six to fourteen. After that there is really not much
for them. Students may go to a private school for further education, but
they are pretty expensive for most people in Cambodia.</p>
<p>JWOC has programs in five key areas: Community Assistance, Clean Water,
Microfinance, Free Classes, and Scholarships. The scholarship program is
the heart of it all. Since 2005 JWOC has provided 120 scholarships for
students to get a university education. However, these students must in
turn give back by volunteering their time on another JWOC program. The
instructor of the class we participated in this afternoon was one such
student.</p>
<p>At the JWOC center in Siem Reap they have students from age 4 all the
way to 60. The classes are open to anyone in the community and range
from english, to sewing, to gardening, to computers. The class we worked
with was a hospitality class. You can think of it as an enrichment
course for students who are interested in improving their english so
they can work in the hospitality industry. One student wanted to be a
hotel receptionist, another told us he wanted to be guide.</p>
<p>We started out the class with everyone introducing themselves. There was
much smiling and laughing and clapping as we went around the room. Their
enthusiasm was infectious. After the intros we moved on to some role
play<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. The instructor paired us up, and I played the role of a
tourist who wanted to book a room, while my student played the role of
someone at the front desk of hotel. I had a list of features that I
wanted in my room and he had information about what they had available
and the associated prices. He was into it! First he had to clarify
several points with the instructor, and then we started out. After
working our way through a fairly lengthy conversation, he said. &ldquo;We
need to do this again. We need to be the best so that we can perform for
the class.&rdquo; So we did it again.</p>
<p>When the teacher asked for volunteers to do their role play for the
class I think he might have been a little disappointed that there was no
choice based on merit, but he was undaunted and quickly volunteered us
for the job. Here we are in the front of the classroom playing our
roles:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bb22e83f45.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Jane also had an excellent student, that I wish I could have talked with
some more. He wants to be an engineer, and is enthusiastically studying
math and physics.</p>
<p>After the role playing was done we had about 20 minutes for free
conversation. They divided the class in two, and put each of us with one
group. The instructor said that since I was a professor they could ask
me about anything. No pressure. We were all grinning from ear to ear
even though they were a bit shy about asking questions. They wanted to
know about where I was from, and what kind of crops we had, which led to
a little discussion about how cold it is in Iowa. One of them was
wearing a Chelsea shirt so that led to some quick conversation about
football. Then I asked about what I should see or things I should eat. I
think they were all impressed when I said we had already tried Amok and
Lak Lok.</p>
<p>One student had been holding back and I could tell he wanted to ask me
something, but he said he was to embarrassed. With a bit of coaxing he
finally asked me: &ldquo;what good are computers?&rdquo; Well, now that is a
question. Nobody laughed at him for asking it. What good is something
that I take for granted and use all day everyday? So we talked about how
you could use computers to learn things, anything you wanted to know you
could find out. Only one of the students in my group had heard of
Google! We talked a little about their markets and how they bought
everything they wanted at the local market. I tried to describe how I
used the computer to do my shopping. I can buy anything I want on the
computer and a truck brings it to my house in two days. I may just as
well have sprouted a second head.</p>
<p>Our hour was over in no time. But we left with such respect for these
students. They were so enthusiastic and supportive of each other. It was
a class like nothing I&rsquo;ve experienced before.</p>
<p>Afterward we had a chance to talk with the education coordinator here in
Siem Reap. She is an American from Connecticut who has been here about
five months and had some nice insights to share with us. It is true that
these students value education in a very different way because it is so
special. She told us about the collaborative nature of the Cambodian
culture and how important that is to their educational experience.
Something that I never would have really understood before spending time
here. But I&rsquo;m glad that I did.</p>
<p>Here is the class with all of us all together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those stairs are too steep,&rdquo; said our guid Sina. Those stairs must be
climbed I said to myself. We were only about an hour into our afternoon
of bike riding when we came across this out of the way temple. The
staircases are at about a 60-70 degree angle to force people to focus on
their climb to the top. We had been looking at these all day at various
temples, but in each case the authorities had helpfully built a wooden
staircase at a much more gentle angle. Out here away from the crowds was
a chance to try the real thing. So, we rode around the back, there were
identical stairs on all four sides, and I stopped my bike. &ldquo;Just a
few?&rdquo; I asked? OK, So I quickly climbed up about 10 or 12 stairs. With
a smile and a gesture Sina told me it was OK to continue as far as I
wanted, which was all the way to the top.</p>

<p>It turns out that this was just the beginning of a great afternoon of
adventures on our rented mountain bikes. The bikes allowed us to get to
places of the giant temple complex that most people don&rsquo;t go to because
its a long walk on paths that are not very well marked.</p>
<p>You carry your bike through a dry creek bed and an ancient door on the
other side and you are treated to another amazing site. Way in the far
back of the temple we did some serious mountain biking, and climbing.
Even our guide asked us to take a picture of himself on his bike to show
his friends. Actually I think he posted it on Facebook immediately. Look
where I took the crazy Americans today! This was toward the end of our
ride, so you can see some of the amazing golden colors of the late
afternoon sun.</p>

<p>|</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/1183f882f0.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>One place we did get off the bikes and walk around was at the Bayon
temple. This was built by King Jayavarman VII. Yeah, I can&rsquo;t say it
either -- even after hearing our guide say it several times. We ended
up just going by seven. My favorite was Udayadityavarman I who predated
VII by about 80 years. Anyway, Jayavarman VII was a very long lived
king, and a very good king. He built many temples, and took care of the
people. They have a children&rsquo;s hospital in Siem Reap named after him.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ef51e68c12.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>As you are walking through the temples with the guide it is really
interesting to hear about the history. Many of the temples were
originally built as Hindu temples and then later converted into Buddhist
temples. Some are the other way around, it just depended on who was in
charge at the time they were built.</p>
<p>Most of the temples we visited were built between 950 and 1180. At some
point most of them were abandoned and fell into ruin until they were
rediscovered largely by the French in the early 1900&rsquo;s. Of course some
of the discoverers were corrupt and tried to loot the temples and sell
off the amazing bas relief stone carvings back home. But others financed
the beginnings of the restoration of these places.</p>
<p>Every one of those towers in the Bayon temple has the face of Jayavarman
VII on four sides. It is said that this symbolizes that the king was
watching everything and everyone at all times.</p>
<p>Because the Cambodian government is quite corrupt, and it is quite a
poor country, many of the restoration projects we saw over the last few
days were financed by other countries. Some by Japan and Korea, to
provide a great tourism experience for their people, others by India and
other countries for maybe more altruistic reasons.</p>
<p>One other bit of excitement for the day happened when we made a comfort
stop. It turned out the elephants were headed to the same place.</p>

<p>Wake up call, 4:30 a.m. Oh-dark-thirty as some would say. After a full
day of travel yesterday, from Halong Bay, and a crazy arrival process in
Siem Reap, we started our first full day in Cambodia plenty early. Our
guide and driver met us at reception at 5 a.m and we headed for Angkor
Wat in the darkness. We wanted to get a good spot to watch the sun rise
behind the temple. When we got there the moon was still up and it was
pitch dark. But as we sat and got to know our guide a bit, we began to
see a shadow of the temple emerge from the dark sky. Gradually, the day
dawned, and the clouds reddened and the temple became fully visible.</p>
<p>It was worth the short night to join the throngs of other people and see
the sun come up. As we sat and began to wonder if we would see our
friends Ann and Jerry among all of the other people there, Jane suddenly
said &ldquo;is that Jerry?&rdquo; Then a moment later she spotted Ann and we
started waving. So right there we had a little reunion with our friends
and traveling companions. Since it was the right time, Jerry and I did
an abbreviated workout in honor of our P90X buddies back home.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9c7dd98c46.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>We each had to go on our way for the day, Jerry and Ann with their
Luther Students in tow, and us with our Guide Sina to visit the temple.
We will meet up with them for dinner in town tonight.</p>
<p>Right now we are resting after being at the temple for about 4 hours.
We&rsquo;ll meet our guide again at 1:00 for lunch and a bike ride to the
Angkor Thom temple.</p>

			 <h1 id="lifestyle-reflections">Lifestyle Reflections</h1>
<p>Note: I wrote the first part of this post as a draft, while in Cambodia,
and then forgot to &ldquo;un-draft&rdquo; it. So I just realized four months later
that it has not been finished or published. I will finish and publish it
now.</p>
<p>Some of my earliest memories are of a small house in a small town in
Southwestern Minnesota in the late 1960&rsquo;s. My Grandma Sundahl lived in
this house. As you came in the side door, you could turn left and go up
a few stairs to the kitchen, or straight down the stairs to the
basement. The basement had three rooms, a laundry room off to the left
as you went down the stairs. I remember big crockery bowls on the
counter in that room and a big black adding machine that we could play
with endlessly. To the right was a cinder block room with a cement
floor. Grandma had painted the walls and decorated them with big posters
of the Campbell Soup kids. There was a ping pong table at one end. As
far as I can remebmer the other end of that room was open for us to run
around in. Straight ahead as you reached the bottom of the stairs was
the big dark scary room. there was a shower in there, that I never
really wanted to shower in. This was also the room where Grandpa
Sundahl&rsquo;s tools were.</p>
<p>In the kitchen the sink was straight ahead as you entered with a window
to the back yard yard. I remember using the hand mixer in that sink
hundreds of times to make more bubbles out of the dish soap. To the
right of the sink was a stack of shelves. The third door down was the
magic drawer. There was always a package of M&amp;M&rsquo;s for each of us, and
this was where Grandma kept the matches for her cigarettes, which we hid
endlessly. Behind the sink was the gas stove and refrigerator. A felix
the cat clock was on the wall over the small kitchen table.</p>
<p>In the living room was a black and white television. If we wanted to
watch Rocky and Bullwinkle we would have to turn the rotor to point the
antenna towards Sioux Falls in the west. Sadly, Lawrence Welk was
non-negotiable and required the rotor to point the antenna towards
Mankato in the Northwest.</p>
<p>The upstairs was my personal kingdom. The stairway divided the small
dormer style upstairs room into two halves. There was a half-wall around
the stair to keep you from falling, and we would endlessly pile up
grandma&rsquo;s pillows on a blanket that we stretched across and over the
stair. We would call grandma to come upstairs and then drop the pillows
on her. Amazingly she never caught on.</p>
<p>In Storden we were allowed to walk anywhere on our own. We could go to
Witt&rsquo;s grocery store and get groceries for grandma, and of course a
pushup, or some other ice cream treat for our efforts. As far as I
remember no money was exchanged everything was done on account. Down the
road from the grocery store was the elementary school with swings,
teeter totters, and of course the tall metal slippery slide with a big
hump in the middle. Nothing was made of plastic in those days, there
were no soft recycled bits of anything to land in at the bottom of the
slide.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why I&rsquo;ve just written four paragraphs of memories
about small town Minnesota life in the late 60&rsquo;s when I&rsquo;m in the
middle of Cambodia. Actually I&rsquo;m a bit surprised myself, but once I
started, the memories kept following one after the other, and it seemed
right to get them down. Maybe this blog needs a good editor! Still, its
a valid question.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about those early days as I&rsquo;ve been traveling
through Vietnam and now Cambodia these last few weeks. Its not a
conscious effort on my part, the memories just keep arising as we drive
around.</p>
<p>My learning style is to make connections between things I know and the
things I&rsquo;m learning. I find patterns, and make associations. You may be
wondering what connections and parallels I see between Southwest
Minnesota and the Southeast Asian countries of Vietnam and Cambodia. To
me the parallels are obvious.</p>
<p>For me, these memories of my childhood represent a simple &ldquo;make do&rdquo;
style of living. We had fun, but it wasn&rsquo;t expensive and it wasn&rsquo;t
complicated. Later in life I learned that my Mom, the oldest child, and
grandma and grandpa had lived in the basement for a period in order to
save the money to build the rest of the house.</p>
<p>### Here we pick up the thread several months later</p>
<p>After four months in Malta and around the Mediterranean, I think I
understand why I was writing a lot of what I wrote. I comes down to
thinking about your own lifestyle. The stark contrast in January between
my own lavish lifetyle and the lifestyle I&rsquo;ve lived in Malta these last
four months is pretty amazing. I have learned to live with <strong>a lot</strong>
less than I do at home, I have learned to enjoy cooking and eating even
without my gourmet kitchen, I have accomplished a lot of development
work on projects that I am truly passionate about with nothing but a
laptop and an internet connection.</p>
<p>The flat we live in was built in the 1950&rsquo;s probably a decade after the
house in Storden was built. There is almost nothing in common between
this long narrow limestone flat, and the house in Storden other than the
shared experiences of the members of the generation that built each
structure.</p>
<p>One of the interesting things about Malta is that the tension between
the generations is more evident to me on Malta than it is in my own
country. There is a real sadness among the older generation about how
the island has changed in the last 30 years, and i guess I honestly
can&rsquo;t say how the younger generation feels, but I can observe their
actions as they overbuild, and overuse the limited resources available
to them on the island.</p>

			 <h1 id="halong-bay">Halong Bay</h1>
<p>We&rsquo;ve just finished our morning stair workout. Four hundred thirty
seven stairs to climb to the top of Ti Top island. The island was named
by Ho Chi Minh, and a Russian astronaut. From the very top of this
island you get a panoramic view of all of the junks and other nearby
islands. What can you say about the views in one of the seven natural
wonders of the world? Good Job selection committee! You can take all of
the adjectives you can think of amazing, beautiful, breathtaking,
romantic, peaceful and it still won&rsquo;t do justice to what you see in
Halong Bay.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/db87b813a9.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>We boarded our Junk, Violet, around 1:00 p.m three days ago. Our cruise
director, Tom (One of the few Vietnamese we&rsquo;ve met that uses an
American name), gave us a short safety demonstration, in place of the
usual lifeboat drill. We were then shown to our suite. We were in the
water suite, old creaky wooden floors, windows everywhere, and a TV we
never turned on in one corner. The bathroom was larger than some
American cruise ship staterooms we have stayed in. The balcony opened to
the front of the boat. Our room was just above water level, with the
window going all the way to the floor, so it was almost like living and
sleeping right on top of the water. There are only six suites on the
ship, this first night they are all occupied by four Americans, six
Brazilians, and two Swiss honeymooners.</p>
<p>As we ate our lunch, and chatted with the other American couple the boat
got underway. We really wished that we were not trapped in the dining
room as it was our first exposure to the islands of Halong Bay. There
are almost two thousand small islands in Halong Bay. The Limestone
islands seem to jut straight out of the water and the sides are so steep
that few are inhabited. Just for Mike, I will say that the geology of
the bay is ancient karst (like Decorah!) Resulting from over 500 million
years of sea regression, tectonic down-warping and sea transgression.
Soon enough, we were done with lunch and up on the top deck to enjoy the
scenery.</p>
<p>Later in the afternoon, we visited a floating village. The people live
here year around. I heard others say that they live a very primitive
existence, I think primitive is the wrong word. Simple would be a better
choice in my opinion. They have some electricity, by means of a
generator. They use it for charging their cell phones, and powering
televisions and other appliances. Their diet, as you might expect,
includes a lot of fish. Everything else, they have to get from the
mainland and bring back by boat. Its a way of life they have chosen, and
so they seem happy.</p>
<p>After the visit to the floating city we take our boat to the Tien Ong
cave. Here we can see many freshwater mussel shells and some stalactites
and stalagmites. We leave the cave just in time to get back to the boat
to watch the sunset over the islands.</p>
<p>We are very glad that we signed up for a two night stay on the boat, as
the second day gave us more time to enjoy the scenery and and do some
biking and Kayaking. We left the Violet for most of the day, so that it
could go back to port and drop off the one-night passengers, and pick up
another group. As it turned out there was only one other couple, from
Toronto, on the boat our second night.</p>
<p>While the Violet went back to port, we transferred to the Sunset with a
couple from Perth Australia. We had a great time talking with them and
touring Cat Ba island. We did a 6k bike ride to a small village where we
were able to tour the village and learn about the endangered Langur
monkey. Biking around the island gave us another perspective of the
interior of the island which is equally as beautiful as the outside.</p>
<p>After our bike ride, we had lunch and then continued on to the Bat Cave
where we were able to do some kayaking for about an hour. Kayaking in
and out of small bays, and under the eroded limestone tunnels was a
great experience. In one small bay we had hoped to see some monkeys, but
they were shy, or on their own vacation so we did see them. After we
returned to the Sunset, Ron and Jane were brave enough to do some
swimming. I had dipped my hand in the water when we were kayaking and
had long since decided against a swim.</p>
<p><img src="/images/halongbay/batcave.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>|</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/b113ef13e0.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>After an hour of relaxing -- our host on the Sunset was very big on
that word -- we returned to the Violet for another great sunset, some
wine, and a good meal. Having no internet we read and just enjoyed the
quiet of the bay. Once all the boats are settled for the night it is
incredibly quiet. All the engines are off and the lights from the other
boats make for quite a romantic scene.</p>
<p><img src="/halongbay/nightships.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>As we were having our breakfast this morning, on the way back to the
mainland, Jane and I both agreed that Halong Bay was our number one
experience of the trip so far. Its kind of sad to rank our experiences
because it needlessly gives the impression that one experience is a
winner, and others are somehow less. It really is the totality of
everything we have done in the last 17 days that makes this such a great
experience.</p>

			 <h1 id="biking-and-cooking-in-hanoi">Biking and Cooking in Hanoi</h1>
<p>This will be my last post for a few days. Tomorrow we board a Junk on
Halong Bay, and I&rsquo;m certain we will not have Internet for our two days
at sea. The next day is a travel day to Cambodia, so I won&rsquo;t have
access for most of that day either.</p>
<p>When I initially requested that we include some biking days in Vietnam,
I had the kind of biking I do back home in mind. Road bike by Trek, a
nice smooth open road with rice paddies on one side, and Water Buffalo
peacefully grazing on the other; sunny weather with no breeze and low
humidity. Perfect right?</p>
<p>This fantasy only goes to show how little I knew about Vietnam. Here is
a picture of me on today&rsquo;s bike.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/3382729233.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Not a trek, although in Vietnam this is a prized bicycle. You must be
one of the top workers in order to obtain this bicycle according to our
guide. Now, I&rsquo;m going to call this a fixie. It had only one gear so
that mostly qualifies. Although it does have handbrakes and I can coast,
so that works against true fixie classification. The second thing you
may have noticed is that it is woefully undersized for me. The seat
posts in Vietnam do not allow for much adjustment for American height
males. And the frame is similarly small. People in the market were
literally laughing at the big american on the small bike as we rode by
today.</p>
<p>All of this really makes me appreciate two things. One: bicycles are an
important and prized mode of transportation here. We have seen thousands
of people riding them to work and school each day, in big cities and
small villages. Two: The importance of a bike that actually fits you.</p>
<p>Although we were not on nice trek road bikes, the scenery today was
great.</p>
<p>After the bike ride, we had lunch at the home of Ms Qiy. She is a
retired professor of Vietnamese culture at one of the universities in
Hanoi. But now she lives in her family home outside of hanoi. Their
family home goes back 21 generations! She lives in the home with her
youngest brother, and his children. At the back of the home is a shrine
where they worship all of their ancestors.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9b5b4243cf.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>For Lunch we had fried spring rolls, some delicious pork wrapped in La
Lota leaves, along with salad and rice vermicelli noodles. We got
another nice lesson (and top secret recipe) for making spring rolls.</p>

<p>|</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/a6db7bfa70.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>We were hoping to visit a primary school to speak english with some of
the students but that did not work out as it is near the end of the
year, and the principal and teachers had meetings that conflicted. On
the other hand we were greeted by many school children as we left the
village today. They all enjoy saying Hello to us, partly because we
stick out so much, and partly because I think they want to see if we
will respond. These two were especially cute as they chased us down the
street on their bikes. Not only did we get a &ldquo;hello&rdquo; from them but
also a &ldquo;good afternoon.&rdquo; When we stopped and asked them their names
they became very shy.</p>

<p>The following post appears on the Luther College <a href="https://www.luther.edu/ideas-creations-blog/">Ideas and Creations
Blog</a></p>
<p>Saturday, 12:30 p.m.: Our guide told us the best way of visiting the war
museum here in Saigon is to start on the third floor and work your way
down. As we rounded the staircase onto the second floor we were met with
the title for the main gallery on that floor: &ldquo;War Crimes of America&rdquo;
Wow! I wasn&rsquo;t expecting that. Suddenly I felt very uncomfortable.
Throughout the museum we were confronted with images and stories of
Agent Orange, senseless killings, Graphs depicting the numbers of bombs
dropped on Vietnam in various years, and the use of Napalm. Clearly
museums are not just dry exhibitions of facts, but can have their own
point of view.</p>
<p>Sunday, 10:00 a.m.: Our first stop today is at a family run restaurant
of the girl, Kim Phuc, she is widely known as &ldquo;The girl in the
picture&rdquo; A pulitzer prize winning photo that many say galvanized the
antiwar movement in the United States. It is a haunting photo, and the
rest of her story is very moving. It is not easy to hear, it is even
more difficult to imagine that our country would do that to a child.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/15e1d9d141.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Sunday, 1:00 p.m.: Our final stop of the day is at the Cu Chi tunnels
where we meet a Viet Cong veteran, and watch a 1967 documentary that
extolls the virtues of the &ldquo;war heroes&rdquo; who killed many americans, and
destroyed many American Tanks. We learn about the cleverness and the
bravery of the Viet Cong who set booby traps to kill the Americans, and
lived in the tunnels of Cu Chi for years.</p>
<p>Monday, 4 a.m.: I awoke with a start, my heart was pounding, and my
thoughts were already on the day ahead. Today was a biking day in the
Mekong Delta, but tonight was our &ldquo;home stay&rdquo; night. I was a little
panicked. Our guide had informed us last night that there would be no
hot water and no air conditioning at our home stay. The high today would
be over 90 degrees, and the humidity about what you would expect in the
Jungle. We saw a lot of houses that I would not want to stay in the
previous day. I think to myself, &ldquo;Is there any way to get out of this?
Why would I want to do a home stay when I am in this really nice
hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tuesday, 1:30PM: Our guide invites me to turn around, so that he can
drape a Python over my shoulders. I have a lifelong fear of snakes, and
as you can see, this is a big one. However, since I teach a programming
language by the same name, and I know that many of my first year
students struggle with the language, it somehow seems appropriate for me
to over come that fear, and so the snake goes around my shoulders.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/82f3996308.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>When my wife Jane and I told people we were going to Vietnam, we saw
many different reactions: confused, worried, envious, and even
peevishness. The mention of this country is capable of invoking a wide
variety of emotions in people. I guess that is inevitable; there is the
ghost of the war, and many have friends and family who died here. For
some Vietnam is too far away, we are 13 hours ahead of Decorah and
Luther College time. Politics: along with China and Cuba Vietnam is one
of the few remaining communist countries. So why did we decide to go
here?</p>
<p>Gereon Kopf recently posted about being uncomfortable. I agree with him
that &ldquo;stepping outside your comfort zone&rdquo; is a good thing. It is a
thing that we ask our students to do regularly, and so as a faculty
member I think it is something we ought to ask of ourselves as well. One
good way for me to do this is through traveling and experiencing new
cultures and new points of view. Southeast Asia has long been on our
travel bucket list, and since we will be directing the Malta program for
Luther this Spring we decided that going to Malta the long way around,
with a stop in Vietnam was a good way to extend our travels.</p>
<p>The vignettes at the start of this post illustrate several ways in which
I have been pushed out of my comfort zone in only the first few days of
our trip. Now the difficulty for me is that I am a problem solver by
nature. Accusations of war crimes, pictures of young girls bombed with
Napalm, comments from relatives that imply that our being here &ldquo;on
vacation&rdquo; is somehow disrespectful to those who lost their lives in
this country, and Pythons all cry out to be solved in some way. but
there is nothing here I can solve, nothing really to fix. The things
that are making me uncomfortable have largely happened in the past.
There is nothing to do.</p>
<p>My own feelings about the war are not defined by personal experience. I
was born after the US entered the conflict, and was only in kindergarten
at the height of the bombing in 1969. I have no father or uncle or
cousin who fought in the war. It wasn&rsquo;t a topic that was covered in
U.S. History classes when I was in High School, until now, most of my
knowledge of the war came from Hollywood.</p>
<p>This morning we had an interesting conversation with our guide. We asked
her what they teach about the American war in school. She told us, &ldquo;we
teach that you are bad.&rdquo; She told us that she used to be a math
teacher, from a communist family. But then she married a non-communist
from the south. She was blacklisted, and so her prospects as a teacher
were at an end. Her husband&rsquo;s father abandoned his family and fled the
country right after the war, becoming one of the many &ldquo;boat people.&rdquo;
She told us that she knows that we are not bad people. She encouraged us
to tell our friends to visit. This seems to be true of nearly everyone
else we have had contact with. As a guide she has taken many American
veterans back to their former battlefields, and she told us how they are
all so grateful to see that Vietnam has healed and progressed as a
country. It was a wonderful conversation.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5ae0c0fe2b.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Tuesday, 6:30 AM: I am sitting under a thatched roof, at the edge of the
river, enjoying the sunrise, listening to the Roosters crow, as they
have done for the last two hours. Our home stay turned out to be a
rather pleasant visit. I got to make fried Spring rolls in the kitchen
with our hosts last night, and although the mattress was a bit hard and
our room a bit stuffy we slept. The beautiful sunrise reminds me that
everything is alright. More than alright, I am lucky to be here, lucky
to have this experience that gives me a new perspective on our world.
The challenge for me going forward, as it is for all Luther students, is
how I will live out this new perspective in the days and years to come.</p>

<p>Dear British Lady in the pink denim shirt:</p>
<p>Thanks for an entertaining evening of dining. I&rsquo;m just sorry it had to
come at the expense of that nice young assistant manager you abused for
the better part of thirty minutes. What was it about the graffiti filled
walls and sticky menu pages that made you think you were in for a fine
dining experience?</p>
<p>After a day of visiting the Imperial City and the Tomb of Ming Minh we
were in the mood for a drink and a pizza. You ordered some vegetables on
rice. You were looking for vegetables that were steamed to preserve
their color, yet mushy in texture. I hope you are continuing on to Hoi
An. I would be happy to recommend a good cooking school. First you sent
the vegetables back. Then you sent the rice back to be sure it would
stay hot. Then you sent the vegetables back again.</p>
<p>After some debate you decided they were not capable of cooking your
vegetables how you wanted them. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that at this place the
vegetables are microwaved. So, you ordered something and mashed
potatoes. This was also returned to the kitchen. The look on the poor
boy&rsquo;s face when he brought you your third choice was one of pure
fright. He clearly could not imagine that there was any scenario in
which you would enjoy your food and honestly I think he was afraid you
would grab him by the neck and shake him. I wanted to rush over and put
my arm around him to let him know that he was not alone., that there
were those of us around who would protect him should it come to violence
over the quality of the carrots.</p>
<p>You then pulled aside another member of the waitstaff and gave him a
lecture on the proper way to steam vegetables. I can only imagine that
he immediately ran back to tell the chef what he (or she) had been doing
wrong all this time.</p>
<p>Watching your husband during all of this was priceless. Clearly this is
a story he has seen unfold many times. He and your son calmly ate what
was brought to them, enjoying their meal and a beer. They were, of
course, long done before you had something you were willing to eat. So
they patiently waited while you ate.</p>
<p>I almost fell out of my seat when the waiter timidly asked if you would
like desert. I&rsquo;m pretty sure there was nothing he wanted more than for
you to simply vanish. Sadly you refused desert, and so our show came to
an end.</p>
<p>Have you learned nothing while visiting this country?</p>
<p>Today we visited the Thien Mu pagoda and the tomb of Minh Mang. We
travelled by boat on the perfume river. The boat was owned by a nice
couple, with two young children. They live on their boat. It is not
heated, there is no running water. It is typical of so many of the boats
we have used for transportation here in Vietnam. It has a crank start
engine. This is not uncommon for this class in Hue. The government tried
to relocate them to low income housing, but most of them prefer their
boats. So, after trying their apartment they have moved back to the
boat!</p>
<p>The weather has been cold and rainy here in Hue, so it makes everything
seem a bit oppressive.</p>
<p>One interesting story from the tomb, which covers acres of space is that
the king&rsquo;s body was brought in by a secret tunnel, and laid to rest in
one of many many tunnels that were dug in preparation for the burial.
After the body was left, the workers that carried the casket to its
final resting place were beheaded to keep the final location a secret!</p>

			 <h1 id="hang-me">Hang Me</h1>
<p>The name of our lunchtime restaurant today was Hang Me. &ldquo;Do you know
what that means in English?&rdquo;, I asked our guide. &ldquo;Hung Mee?&rdquo; he
replied with a questioning look on his face. No, I said in English we
would pronounce that &ldquo;Hang me!&rdquo; He got it, and and mimicked tightening
a noose around his neck. We had a good morning with our guide, Vu, he
was a last minute stand-in, as our appointed guide had come down with a
high fever.</p>
<p>Hang Me, is definitely not a place we would have wandered into on our
own. It was the kind of local restaurant that was in the wrong place and
looked a little too grungy from the outside for me to even go in. We
ended up at Hang Me because our guide had asked us whether we would like
to go to a tourist restaurant or whether we would like to try some good
local food. It may have been a bit of a leading question put that way,
but we opted for the local food, he had earned our trust so far today.
The local specialties include Banh Beo, Bahn Nam, Tom Cha, and Bahn Ram
it. Need I say more? All of these were variations on a dumpling like
theme. A rice flour mixture with prawn and or pork. They were OK, but in
the end they all kind of blended together in a
gooey-rice-mixture-with-prawns kind of way.</p>

<h2 id="the-thien-vien-truc-lam-bach-ma-pagoda">The Thien Vien Truc Lam Bach Ma Pagoda</h2>
<p>We worked up our appetite by climbing 173 stairs to the Thien Vien Truc
Lam Bach Ma Pagoda. At this point in the trip it might be easy to say
that we are &ldquo;pagodaed out.&rdquo; But, that is not the case today. It was a
bit of a journey to get there but it was well worth the trip. This
Pagoda is set on an island in the middle of a quiet lake surrounded by
high hills (they actually call them mountains here). After driving
through the trees and countryside you arrive at a little parking area,
from there you have to hike a bit more on foot before you come to the
boat landing.</p>
<p>Since it is winter here, the water levels in the lake are a bit hight,
and our boatman made the suggestion that we wade a bit to get to his
boat. But our guide quickly convinces him that is not going to happen.
So we do a little balancing act on a 2x6 to get on the boat and he
pushes off. He starts the boat with a hand crank. The motor has two
settings, forward and stop. The throttle is controlled by a string.</p>
<p>When we arrive at the island we disembark and hike up to the pagoda and
monastery area. It is just beautiful. Aside from the two buildings, one
for chanting and one for meditating, the setting is just unreal. We wish
it wasn&rsquo;t raining, because the colors must be incredibly vibrant in the
sunlight. Even so, we feel like we could be on a movie set for some
jungle adventure. The whole time we are there are only see two other
people which just adds to the experience.</p>
<h2 id="a-postscript-about-football">A Postscript about Football</h2>
<p>Not American football, English football. Its amazing to me what a global
league the English Premier League is. Here I am finishing up my blog
post about today while watching Liverpool play Sunderland on TV at
9:00PM, the game started at 7:45PM. Of course back home this came would
be the &ldquo;early&rdquo; game at 6:45AM. We have struck up conversations with
most of the hotel bar staff as well as the bellman, it was the bellman
who knew how to get the lobby TV to the right channel. Our guide today
knew the names of every member of the Arsenal Invincibles as well as all
the current members of Manchester United.</p>

			 <h1 id="the-red-bridge-cooking-school">The Red Bridge Cooking School</h1>
<p>One of the things I have been anticipating the most on this trip is to
take some cooking classes. Today was our first official lesson, at the
Red Bridge Cooking School.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ca1312c6ad.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Our day started out with a tour of the market, which was nothing new,
except that this time we were guided around by Chef Luna. For the tour
we were put into groups of four. We met a very nice couple from
Southampton England and had great conversation with them all day. Phil
and Jane. It even turns out that her maiden name was Jane Miller, so
what are the odds of that?</p>
<p>After the market tour we took a boat ride out to the restaurant and
cooking school, and had another brief tour of their herb garden. We are
getting lots of ideas for things to plant in our own garden next summer
that we hope will grow in the Iowa summer.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/32b36ced6e.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Then its time for the real lessons to begin. We each get a clipboard
with seven pages of recipes! Luna demonstrates how to make our first
course. This is a rice flour pancake with shrimp and pork and green
onion. When its done we wrap it up in some rice paper with herbs and
salad. Then you make a quick dipping sauce to accompany the rolls. After
the demonstration we are told to leave our recipes at our seats and to
find a station. Now it is time to cook!</p>
<p>Here I am getting ready to make my pancake.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/8ed6a32a96.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really getting in a lot of healthy eating this trip. You just
can&rsquo;t avoid adding in all of the delicious vegetables to your dishes,
and I have to admit they really do taste good. Who knows, this could be
the start of a whole new relationship with vegetables for me.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/b2b99bdac2.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>The pattern set in the first recipe was repeated several times. Our full
menu includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seafood Salad served in a Pineapple boat</li>
<li>Fresh rice paper rolls of shrimp. Yes we learned how to make our own
rice paper!</li>
<li>Vietnamese Eggplan in clay pot. I can&rsquo;t believe I ate eggplant and
actually liked it.</li>
<li>Steamed ocean fish on a bed of fresh vegetables.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was so fun to make everything, and we can&rsquo;t wait to recreate this
cooking school experience for our friends back home.</p>

			 <h1 id="the-flood-gates-of-hoi-an">The Flood Gates of Hoi An</h1>
<p>Throughout all our time so far we have refrained from buying anything,
at the markets we have visited, despite the aggressive sales tactics of
some of the owners. We kept telling ourselves &ldquo;we are traveling light,
everything fits in our carryon. We will not check any luggage.&rdquo; Until
today. The markets of Hoi An have won.</p>
<p>The crack in the dam came yesterday when we visited an art gallery full
of beautifully embroidered works of art. Today, during our free time, we
went back. There were three pieces that we really liked. We narrowed the
field down to my second and third choices. From there we nearly flipped
a coin to decide. We thought about shipping the entire thing, frame and
all, since the frame prices were so reasonable, but in the end we
decided to just take the cloth. The cloth is easy to transport and takes
up very little space, and can be ironed when we get back home before we
frame the piece.</p>
<p>After that little purchase we were hungry and decided to have lunch. One
of the places our tour company recommended in Hoi An is called
<a href="http://www.streetsinternational.org">Streets</a>. We had a fantastic
lunch, and learned a bit about this interesting organization for helping
street kids by giving them 18 months of housing, food, and training in
hospitality and the culinary arts. A delicious meal from a great
organization. So I bought their cookbook.</p>
<p>I love buying cookbooks. I love reading cookbooks. I am a cookbook
collector. There is no better way to remember the culture of a place
than to be recreate the food you ate while visiting. And besides, what
could be easier to transport and lighter to add to your luggage than a
full color cookbook?</p>
<p>There was only one problem. I DON&rsquo;T HAVE ROOM FOR A COOKBOOK. So we did
what any sane travelers would do. We bought some chopsticks, and little
wooden things to rest your chopsticks on, and a box to hold all of our
new chopsticks. In fairness, I have to say that the chopsticks are made
from the wood of a Jackfruit tree. Jane&rsquo;s new favorite fruit. Then Jane
bought some Genie Jammy pants, and a scarf, and I bought a couple of
leather bracelets. Accessorize, accessorize!</p>
<p>In an effort to stop the flow of new goods into our possession, we fled
back to the shopping free zone that is our hotel. Sadly, we didn&rsquo;t make
it past the leather bag store, Tu Chi, that we were &ldquo;just browsing&rdquo; in
yesterday.</p>
<p>The young lady that runs the shop recognized us, and probably had us
pegged as easy marks. She had some help from a guy who I imagine is her
distributor in Russia. He did a nice sales job on the size, and
construction quality of the bags. The one I really liked was a bit too
large to make it past persnickety airline gate agents, so they said they
would make me one that conforms to all the rules. Out comes the leather,
in great big bolts. Which leather would I like, how would I like the top
to zip open? How would I like the straps to be constructed. There was
some discussion, from our new Russian friend, of carrying 20 kilos of
potatoes. Sounds good in theory, but that would be over the weight limit
of most airlines. Nevertheless this custom bag thing is all very cool.
I&rsquo;ll update this post with the finished product tomorrow evening.</p>

<p>I guess we will be checking a bag for the flight to Hanoi after all.</p>
<p>Update: Here is a picture of the bag in progress, and the bag packed and
ready for the airport in our hotel room in Hue.</p>

<p>It all started with motorbike parts. Our first day on the motorbikes, we
went into the market. The first street we turned down was nothing but
bits and pieces of motorbikes. After all, it takes a lot of parts to
keep the millions of 20 year old motorbikes running. From there we saw
everything from television remote controls, to hand wound springs, to
big pieces of metal being cut with very hot torch-like things.</p>
<p>It progressed to the food market. A vast array of over 1000 stalls
carrying everything from dried sea cucumber to sea monkeys to wood ear
mushrooms to live eels to every imaginable spice to picked, well,
everything.</p>
<p>Two days ago in the smaller neighborhood market in the Mekong delta, we
witnessed women buying fresh frogs. They were alive, until the seller
whipped out their kitchen shears and took care of the head and their
horny little toes. How do you top fresh frog in the morning? Hmmm, how
about a stop at the rat market? Rats not your thing? How about fresh
snake? I asked Long if the rats were cheap thinking thats what the
poorer folk ate. No, &ldquo;very expensive&rdquo; They are a delicacy. These are
&ldquo;good rats from the fields, not the rats from the market.&rdquo; OK, I
don&rsquo;t think I really wanted to hear that.</p>
<p>We visited the floating markets of Cai Be, where you can buy sweet
potatoes, bananas, fish, and crabs in massive quantities off of boats
from all around Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>We have ridden our bikes past countless tiny markets, sandwiched between
two houses in the countryside, selling soda, cigarettes, Pho, and
Pringles. Yes, Pringles are surprisingly popular in the small
neighborhood markets.</p>
<p>It is easy to resist buying food items from the markets because you know
there is no chance that it is going to make it through customs at the
next stop. So we look, we smell, we marvel at the variety. One
Australian dude we overheard as we wandered through the food market
yesterday pretty much summed it up: &ldquo;F#ck I wish I could cook!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here are some photos that illustrate our trips through the market places
of Saigon, the Mekong Delta, and now Hoi An.</p>

<p>After four days of non-stop activity, we took a short flight North to
Hoi An. Hoi An, is a very much a vacation area for Vietnamese and
foreigners alike. It is a World Heritage site and will provide us with
some very welcome down time. Maybe more down time than we planned on
since it is supposed to rain the next two days, and I don&rsquo;t think we
will do our bike ride if it is raining.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Long took us to the airport and escorted us through the checkin process
and all the way to security where we bid him goodbye. It is really
comforting traveling with a well trained guide in a country where you
can barely say, hello and thank you. They make everything go smoothly.
After a short flight to Danang, we were met by our guide Binh who will
be with us for our time in Hoi An.</p>
<p>After checking in to the beautiful Ananantara Resort Hotel we went with
Binh for some lunch and a walking tour of the old city. This is
definitely a shopping destination, and I have a feeling we will be
buying (and shipping home) some embroidered artwork. It is so finely
done it is nearly photo realistic quality.</p>
<p>After resting up in our room we went out for a walk through the markets
and shops at night. It is really beautiful here at night. The gallery
below gives you a good idea of the colors here at night.</p>
<p>We totally enjoyed a long walk through the old town. After a while we
stopped at a restaurant called the Seafood Garden. It didn&rsquo;t look
particularly great as a place to eat, and without a data plan we
couldn&rsquo;t just pop up trip advisor. Well we do have a data plan but it
is ridiculously expensive (thanks Verizon), and it seemed obvious just
by looking. (Update: TripAdvisor confirms our suspicions) But they had
an upstairs balcony that we could sit at and have a drink and look out
over the river. The drinks were cheap, and it was entertaining to watch
the old gentleman who was waiting tables hustle tours from all of the
other people around us for the next day.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>We wanted to go back to the restaurant where we had lunch, as I think we
spend a few days just happily working our way through the menu, however
they were booked for the night. Who knew you needed reservations in this
place. We ended up eating at the Hai Cafe where we had some nice
Vietnamese barbecue. This is the restaurant where we will meet for our
cooking class tomorrow.</p>

<p>The Meekong Delta</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/389b38af94.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>The picture pretty much sums up our experience here the last two days.
We have both pushed ourselves outside our comfort zone, we have tried
many new foods, and even took a sip of rice wine that had been
marinating with cobra! Where do you go after a day like that?</p>
<p>Yesterday we left our hotel in the city and headed out to the Meekong
Delta. This is an extremely fertile area where the Meekong river flows
into the Sea. We started our day loading our bikes onto a boat and we
headed up the river into the delta.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/4f15bc80c8.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>We made a stop along the way at a brick factory. It is such a step back
in time, to visit a factory like this in Vietnam. We simply got off the
boat and wandered around talking to a few of the workers. No badges
required, no hard helmets, no insurance waivers. Its a pretty simple
process, clay comes out of the river, and goes into a little hand
operated machine that mikes the clay and extrudes the bricks. After
drying on their own for a few weeks they eventually make it into a big
kiln which is fired by rice husks.</p>
<p>We got off the boat, along with our bikes at another small factory, this
time they were making all kinds of things out of coconuts. Coconut
water, candy, coconut milk, shaved coconut. If it was possible to
squeeze another product out of coconut they would find a way to do it.
Before we set off on our bikes we had a whole plate of fruit to try.
Including dipping your fresh pineapple into a mixture of salt and chile
peppers -- delicious. I ate more fruit yesterday than I have in a year.
Which isn&rsquo;t saying much good about my diet, I know.</p>
<p>After an hour or so of biking through the tiny backroads of the delta we
stopped for lunch. A great outdoor restaurant that basically appeared
out of nowhere. One minute we were biking through the trees and the next
we were pulling into a &ldquo;neighborhood restaurant.&rdquo; Our first course was
fried spring rolls. Love em. Our second consisted of a whole Elephant
Ear fish, fried and presented standup style for us. For you aquarium
keepers this is also known as a Giant Gourami. I&rsquo;ve had gouramis in my
aquarium before, but I never thought I&rsquo;d eat one. Anyway, we learned
how to eat this by rolling the fish, along with some rice noodles and
some pineapple and cucumber and mint, and basil in rice paper. The third
course was a noodle soup which also had two giant prawns for us to try.
Then came a course which consisted of a bowl of rice and some chicken
curry. Of course by this time we were totally stuffed, and leaving all
kinds of food on the table. So of course they have to bring dessert.
Well, more fruit at least.</p>
<p>I honestly do not know how all of the vietnamese people stay so healthy
and slim. From what I have observed in the last three days they eat
insane quantities of food.</p>
<p>After lunch we do a bunch more biking, and then end up at our
&ldquo;homestay&rdquo; house. This was the part of the trip that had me the most
nervous. Honestly, I like my nice hotels, I&rsquo;m really more of an
introvert when it comes to meeting new people, so showing up at
someone&rsquo;s house in the middle of the delta, knowing in advance that the
house did not have air conditioning, internet, or hot water seemed like
a bad idea. But it all worked out.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f310744917.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>One of the great highlights of the evening was our spring roll lesson.
Yep, in a real Vietnamese kitchen I got to learn first hand how to make
one of my all time favorite foods.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/f2fcb3697d.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>It was a pretty early night, and as it turned out pretty sleepless as
well. We were hot, and our mattress was pretty hard, &ldquo;softer than
cement&rdquo; according to Jane. So it was early to bed early to rise. We had
a quick breakfast, and then biked to the local market. In the delta,
locally grown is not a &ldquo;movement,&rdquo; it is a way of life, and has been
for years. The pork that is sold fresh at the market was butchered just
hours ago, and it will all be consumed before the day is out. Fish, eel,
frogs, etc. are all still alive and swimming when you get there, when
you pick out what you want they will fillet them for you. It was all
caught today, and it will all be eaten today. The produce is a similar
story with more kinds of fruits and vegetables available than I can even
think about.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/3e093c2b73.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>After the local market we meet up with our driver again, and we head
somewhere else on the delta to visit the Cai Be floating market. This is
similar to the local market but here things come, by boat, from further
away. Each boat sells its specialty, and you can tell what they are
selling because they have it flying from a flagpole on the boat!</p>
<p>Here is where things take a turn for the weird. It seems that Long has
decided we need to be challenged. So after we get off the boat and bike
for a few feet, he stops and says he wants to show us &ldquo;how they make
honey&rdquo; OK, fine we get to see a beehive, but thats not enough, as he
wants me to hold it. There must be a thousand bees on this thing and he
wants me to just stay calm and hold the thing.</p>
<p>That turned out to be easy compared to the next lesson: a big jar, whats
in the jar? Looks like snakes to me. Gross. Have I mentioned my lifelong
fear of snakes? OK, so its a jar full of rice wine and snakes. Lets see
what kind of snake? Oooooh a Cobra, glad its dead and pickled. Glad he
didn&rsquo;t tell me they were lurking around on the delta until now. Lets
have a toast shall we? Um, really? you want me to drink rice wine that
has been marinating a dead cobra? Fine. Well, it mostly tasted like
strong rice wine, but apparently I&rsquo;m going to be stronger tomorrow.
Yes, just in case you were wondering, they do have a similar variety
featuring a scorpion.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/5f4d9cd68b.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Which brings us to the giant Python. After pulling it out of its cage,
and informing us that it is not poisonous, but does bite. He says, ok
Brad, your turn. Really! I can assure you that holding a giant Python
has never been on my list of things I want to try. I can also assure you
that I had not consumed enough rice wine and cobra to give me the
courage to do this. But, something deep inside me said, if you are going
to teach Python you ought to have a picture of yourself holding a giant
one. So there you have it. More on the Meekong Delta later.</p>

<p>How would you like to live for nine years in an underground house?
Yesterday we met Mr. Nam, who did just that. Mr. Nam fought for the Viet
Cong. First against the French, then against the Americans. The Cu Chi
area is now a park where you can learn about the Viet Cong, including a
very one-sided video produced in 1967.</p>
<p>Then you can actually tour the tunnels. In the gallery below you can see
me entering the tunnel through one of the many hidden entrances. I
emerge again a few minutes later at another hidden entrance about 20
feet away from the first. At 6 feet tall I am definitely not built for
climbing around in these tunnels.</p>
<p>The whole Cu Chi area really gave you a good sense for what the jungle
was like. Bamboo trees, vines, paths through the trees, lots of
overgrown bomb craters. The only thing missing from the war movies
(thankfully!) was pounding rain.</p>

<p>To say that there is a motorbike culture here in Saigon is a bit of an
understatement. The population of Saigon is around seven million people
and there are about four million motorbikes. Today we got to be a part
of it all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll spare you the details of our journey to get here, suffice to say
that we started by leaving our hotel in Bloomington, MN at 5AM on New
Years Day, and we arrived at our hotel in Saigon at 1:05AM on January
3rd. All of the first and second were a spent in airports on or on
planes. I&rsquo;m just going to say one time how happy we were to use our
American frequent flier miles to upgrade to business class. Although we
may be spoiled for life, and never travel any other way again.</p>
<p>Today was our first day of touring with Long, our Saigon guide. Our tour
itinerary said that we were going to have a cultural and culinary
experience by motorbike. For some reason I had a vision in my head of
Jane and I sitting side by side in some kind of three wheel arrangement
with the driver in front of us. This was not the case.</p>
<p>When we met Long this morning in the hotel lobby, he immediately brought
us outside and introduced us to his assistant! Now there are four of us,
my vision for the day was changing rapidly. In the end, we each got a
helmet, and hopped on the motor cycle behind them. Off we went.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/01d1446c77.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Our first stops of the day were the post office, the Catholic cathedral,
the Reunification Palace, and the war museum. I&rsquo;m still trying to
process the war museum, so a post about that will have to wait. Then
lunch at a traditional family Pho restaurant. Beef noodle soup and
spring rolls. Yum.</p>
<p>For me the day really got fun when we just toured through the markets on
the motorbikes. We drove down hundreds of narrow streets that no car or
tour bus would ever venture down, and we noticed that there is almost
nothing you can not carry on the back of a motorbike. The first thing
that caused me to do a double take was a motorbike carrying 50 bags of
goldfish! Then I noticed the man with five 20 liter water bottles
balanced. Next was big plastic tub full of live lobster. The gallery
below has some of our favorites.</p>
<p>Now I know some of you are wondering about our sanity. Arriving in a big
city and jumping on the back of a motorbike for a day of touring. I have
to say that I felt like I was not totally safe the entire time. There is
something very interesting about sitting knee to knee with a stranger at
a stoplight in a new city that makes you feel like you are getting to
know the people.</p>
<p>Turning left at a busy intersection is a somewhat intricate dance. The
first thing you do is get in the left lane and drive straight at the
oncoming traffic, which magically veers around you as if you were not
even there. Then when you turn left you can do it at almost any time. My
preferred time is when the bus in front of you also turns left and acts
as a giant shield. But it turns out that oncoming traffic slows, and
traffic coming from the right also makes way and suddenly you are just
going left. Its kind of like they can all read each others minds and
just know when to slow down, when to speed up, and when to merge. I have
some suspicion that this is accomplished by a secret code that is
communicated by honking your horn, but I have yet to break the code.</p>
<p>I keep thinking to myself how this would never work in America. Someone
would surely run into someone else just to prove the point that they had
the right of way. A day on one corner of riding like this in America
would surely beget a thousand lawsuits.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an inadvertent selfie I got as I was taking a photo as we were
driving down the street.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9dd116f915.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>The marketplaces we visited are just mind boggling. Street after street
of motorbike parts, electronics, cookware, you name it. At one stall
there were hundreds and hundreds of television remotes. If you need a
replacement, and can find this stall I&rsquo;m sure they would have just what
you need. I&rsquo;m not sure how this economy works. It seems like total
chaos to me, but it was clear that people were doing business. Orders
were taken, things were being welded or cut, and things were delivered.</p>
<p>In the food marketplace there were thousands of stalls. Everything was
jammed so close together you could hardly walk down the aisles. The
merchants must show about about 5am every morning to lay out their
wares, and then put everything away again at the end of the night. Some
stalls are so specialized you can&rsquo;t imagine that they could possibly
make it, but there they are, taking orders on their phones, doing their
books, and scooping out things to deliver.</p>
<p>At the end of the day we sent off two more loaded down motorbikes. Our
guides took off carrying our large suitcases. We had planned to travel
light for the rest of our time in Vietnam, and so we will catch up with
our bags in Cambodia.</p>

<p>All of our students arrived safely by 11:00 last night. We got them up
early this morning for a bit of sightseeing and wandering around
Valletta. We all did The Malta Experience, which gave us an amazing
overview of the history of this island dating back to 4000 BC. It is
really incredible, Malta has been ruled by: Phoenicians, Carthaginians,
Romans, Byzantine, Arab, Norman, Swabian, Aragonese, The Knights of St.
John, French, and British! I&rsquo;m sure I left out a few! A lot of it has
to do with the fact that Malta is right on the trade route from the
eastern to the western Mediterranean and beyond. I am really looking
forward to our history class which starts this week.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we are enjoying the sunshine, and the Amazing views
that are everywhere!</p>

<p>In the Christian church, Advent is a season of waiting, a season of
anticipation. Normally, we are waiting and anticipating the celebration
of the birth of Christ. Christmas! This year is no different, but it is
a bit hard to not look just past Christmas at what awaits us in the new
year. Adventure. I never thought about the fact that adventure begins
with advent.</p>
<p>On January first, we will board a plane for Vietnam. We&rsquo;ll spend three
weeks in Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, and then head to our home for
the Spring semester on the Island of Malta. We&rsquo;ve been telling people
that Vietnam is right on the way to Malta. On January 30th our 12 Luther
students will join us and move in to one of the three flats in Sliema,
just two blocks from this amazing view. I have to pinch myself just
thinking that I&rsquo;m going to be living on an island in the Mediterranean
for five months.</p>

</code></pre><p>Our students begin classes February second. We will join in the fun,
becoming students ourselves for the history of Malta class. But, after
one short week of class we will take them to Rome for four days. At the
end of March we will take them to Morocco for a week, and then the
students will have another week to travel on their own. While they are
off enjoying the wonders of Europe Jane and I will be biking through the
Andalusia region of Spain. In May our adventure takes us to Istanbul for
a long weekend. We are hoping to fit in a short trip to Sicily or maybe
Tunisia.</p>
<p>The students leave after the first week of June, and then Jane and I
will treat ourselves to a cruise beginning in Venice and through the
greek isles. We will end in Istanbul, but quickly join up with a Luther
alumni tour hosted by our friends for a few days in Prague. We may even
see our old foreign exchange student Cenek! From Prague we fly home,
exhausted, no doubt.</p>
<p>Here is a look at our preparatory piles as we begin to organize and pack
for the big odyssey.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/17e31d43ec.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>Christmas gifts are travel-related this year, versatile clothes, shoes,
and camera gadgets, as we anticipate the experiences of the next six
months. Most of them are going directly into the suitcase rather than
under the tree. We are really looking forward to this opportunity to
immerse ourselves in a new culture in a way that you cannot do by being
a tourist for a few weeks. Watch this blog, as I will be writing about
our journey here.</p>
<p>Many may say, ooh! you shouldn&rsquo;t be writing about this people will read
this and break in. Well, I can&rsquo;t not document this incredible journey.
And I have six words for the would-be breaker inners. Home Security, Web
Cams, House Sitter. We are covered.</p>

			 <p>When we were in Las Vegas last fall, I had the most delicious steak I&rsquo;ve
ever eaten. It was at Bobby Flay&rsquo;s Mesa Grill. This blew me away.
Although I love a good steak at a restaurant, usually I can do just as
well at home. But this steak was amazing. This was a two inch think
tenderloin that was perfectly medium rare from edge to edge! The very
outside edge was seared perfectly too. Whoa, I thought at the time, how
did they do that? How can you have a steak so uniformly done? The answer
of course is Sous-vide.</p>
<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve been reading the books, like <em>Modernist Cuisine at
Home</em>, and lots of articles on &ldquo;Serious Eats&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ve seen it done on
<em>Chopped</em> and <em>Iron Chef</em>. Then the other day I got a Kickstarter notice
about the new Anova Precision Cooker. Its an immersion circulator that
lets you do sous-vide cooking without one of the big fancy sous-vide
appliances. This just clips on the edge of one of your big pots, and
away you go. Alton Brown would love it. Unfortunately this new fancy one
that even connects to your iPhone will not be available until later this
year, so I decided to give the Nomiku a try. It was the highest rated of
three options on Amazon, and was Prime Eligible. If I really like it I
figure I can always upgrade to the Anova later. So here's my setup for
an afternoon of high-tech cooking:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9c50082bd9.jpg" alt="image"></p>
<p>The idea behind sous-vide cooking is that you can cook at a lower
temperature for a longer period of time. bringing the water and your
food into equilibrium. Whats cool about that is that you can cook a
steak to exactly 132 degrees, and you can leave it go for an extra hour
or two and it will remain at the perfect medium rare done-ness. You can
also cook chicken. without heating it to 165 degrees!</p>
<p>What!? I thought? this cannot be. But then I started to do some reading
and once again science rocks.
&lt;<a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/sous-vide-basics-low-temperature-chicken.html">www.seriouseats.com/2010/04/s&hellip;</a>&gt;
It turns out that you can kill all the nasty bacteria at 135 degrees, it
just takes longer! Like 90 minutes! Heating chicken to 165 kills the
bacteria too, instantly. But it also gives you dry chicken.</p>
<p>One other aspect of sous vide is that you use a vacuum sealer to seal
your food in plastic before you immerse it in the water. This allows you
to season the food and add aromatics to your bag. Yum.</p>
<p>Of course this also precipitated a quick trip to the hardware store to
get a FoodSaver vacuum sealer. Yay more kitchen toys.</p>
<p>Right now, I&rsquo;m trying a steak. I sealed it up and dropped it in. In a
couple of hours I&rsquo;ll get out the cast iron skillet and heat it up good
and hot, so that I can sear the meat when it comes out. A glass of
Rombaur and a baked potato and I&rsquo;m all set.</p>

			 <p>It has been an exciting day!   I just got back from Cedar Rapids where I attended a mixer of mentors and teams at the<a href="http://www.iowastartupaccelerator.com"> Iowa Startup Accelerator</a>.  The accelerator officially launched yesterday with 10 new teams.  There was some good local <a href="http://www.cbs2iowa.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/created-corridor-ia-startup-accelerator-28963.shtml">news coverage</a> and lots of excitement by the teams.  Some of them are from Iowa and one team is from as far away as Australia.</p>
<p>My role, as a mentor, will be to work with one or more teams over the next few months, giving them advice and feedback, and trying to connect them with the right people to help them grow their company.  Over the next few weeks I&rsquo;ll be spending some time meeting with each of the ten teams to get to know them better, and then we will see if there is a particular team that I can really help.  I hope so, tonight was fun, and the enthusiasm is infectious.</p>

			 <h1 id="winter-skiing-in-the-spring">Winter Skiing in the Spring</h1>
<p>Two days of skiing at Tahoe are in the bag, but what a difference
between the two days. Yesterday we got the true spring skiing
experience. It was cool and crusty in the morning and a bit slushy in
the afternoon. Its been a pretty bad winter here in Tahoe so a lot of
the runs were not accessible. In the morning we went up the Stagecoach
express and turned left, to try the Stagecoach run. It was the worst
skiing I have ever experienced in my life. Thankfully, we learned the
trick. Stay on the groomed runs! Once we figured that out the day was a
blast, if a bit repetitive. One thing you can&rsquo;t beat is the views.
Bright sunny day, clear blue sky, good friends to ski with. What could
be better?</p>
<p>I also love this photo for all of the layers. High clouds, low clouds,
shadows of clouds on the brown/green valley floor below.</p>
<p>Overnight, the winds kicked in, and the snow came down. Up to eight
inches in the higher elevations. This made for a second day of
mid-winter like skiing. Suddenly, all the runs that were not good
yesterday were very ski-able with a fresh layer of snow. The only
downside was that the winds and snow continued. We were told in the
morning that all the lifts might have to shut down, at some point
because thunder (and lightning) were in the forecast for the day. I&rsquo;ve
never thought about being up on a ski lift in a thunderstorm before but
I&rsquo;m pretty sure I wouldn&rsquo;t want to be there.</p>
<p>In any case, if they do shut down certain of the lifts, then you are in
trouble anyway...</p>

<p>A Rare Day</p>
<p>Lake Tahoe is beautiful. We arrived last night from Napa and got to our
VRBO home, it is great and we had a beautiful view of the lake out our
windows. The sun was just going down and I captured this picture of the
Sequoia outside our window.</p>

<p>I must confess, after all of the Chardonnay I&rsquo;ve consumed, and I have consumed my share over the years, I have never really got the &ldquo;buttery oaky Chardonnay&rdquo; thing.  Butter is just not something I&rsquo;ve ever tasted in my Chardonnay, despite the fact that one of my all time favorites is Rombaur, which according to more than one person in Napa, is the &ldquo;poster child&rdquo; for buttery oaky Chardonnays. Really, who wants their Chardonnay to taste like butter?  The whole describing wine thing is another thing I find really interesting.  One of the tasting room hosts, recommended the movie <em>Somm</em> to us as we were chatting.  I see you can get/rent it on iTunes, so I&rsquo;m adding that to my list.  Its about a group of guys preparing for the master sommelier exam, which may sound a bit dull, but the reviews for it are fantastic.</p>
<p>But after two days of tastings in Napa its all clear to me now.  The key that helped me understand the difference, and I&rsquo;m confident I&rsquo;m now an expert, is Malolactic Fermentation.  The science of it all, unsurprisingly, has stuck in my brain.  Here&rsquo;s a quick summary of more than you ever probably wanted to know.</p>
<p>Malolactic Fermentation is the process of converting Malic Acid (which tastes tart,and citrussy to my mouth) to Lactic Acid which is a much more mellow flavor.  Malolactic fermentation occurs after fermentation and is the result of injecting a particular bacteria into the process.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/3b9fe425b1.jpg" alt="William Hill"></p>
<p>Now, to each his own, but I can say that I am a fan of Malolactic Fermentation.  Here are some of my favorites:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rombaur</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>William Hill</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Carpe Deim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poseidon&rsquo;s Vineyard</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conquering-the-tannins">Conquering the Tannins</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never been able to drink red wine much due to my allergies.  What am I allergic to in red wine?  Tannin is a chemical that comes from the skins, seeds, and stems of the wine.  They are much more prevalent in red wine than in white.  Now according to our host at Chateau Montelena (see also the movie Bottle Shock) I need to develop a resistance to Tannins in order to drink red wine.  The way to do this, according to this would be allergist, is to begin with Pinot Noir, and work my way up from there.  Well it sounds like a project, and I do enjoy a nice glass of Pinot.  So, something to work on.  All in the name of self improvement of course.</p>

			 <p>During my January travels, I also converted this blog from tubmlr, which had been frustrating me for a while, to Octopress, with which I have been very happy.  Nothing like hacker level control of your own blog.  But more, than just the switch in tools, the move to Octopress inspired me to make it easier for people to publish small or large works using the Runestone tools.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Learning @ Scale conference we demoed this new capability.  See [the demo here](&lt;http://runestoneinteractive.org/LearningAtScale).  To make it super easy to publish:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lecture slides</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Demonstrations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Tutorial</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lab Instructions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In class exercises</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A short module on your favorite topic not covered elsewhere</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An entire book</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h3 id="building">Building</h3>
<p>You can simply follow the instructions at this new repository:  <a href="http://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/RunestoneTools">github.com/RunestoneInteractive/RunestoneTools</a>.  In a nutshell:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Install Sphinx, paver, and paverutils using pip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clone the repository</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit the index.rst file in source, and add any additional rst files you may want, depending on how complex your project is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>run <code>paver build</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="deploying">Deploying</h3>
<p>Now you have a choice.  In the build directory you have a nice self contained set of html files, these files are set up to make use of the runestone server invisibly in the background.  The static html can be served from any web server.  Just drop in the build directory and you are ready to serve.  OR, you can now host and deploy your project using <strong>GitHub Pages</strong>.  To host on github pages you need to do three things.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Create an empty repository in your github account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>run <code>paver setup_github_pages</code> and paste in the URL of the new account.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>run paver deploy</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now your pages will be available at:  <a href="http://youraccount.github.io/YourRepo">http://youraccount.github.io/YourRepo</a></p>
<p>If you want to host these pages behind a custom domain name, you can follow the instructions on github for doing so.  Hint:  Its really easy.</p>
<p>I hope this new capability will inspire lots of people to give these tools a try.  I also hope that we can build a repository of resources built with the tools, so that we can all share our teaching ideas.  Stay tuned for more on that.</p>
<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>
<p>All of the features, activecode, codelens, assessment questions, parson&rsquo;s problems, <a href="http://interactivepython.org/overview/overview.html">and more</a> work just fine.  The major thing that will not work (yet!) is the login/logout.  I need to rework our authentication system in order for this to work.  This will for sure need to happen before the end of summer.</p>

			 <p>I left home on December 27 2013.  When I left I had 3 bags packed.  One for our trip to Mazatlan to celebrate the new year with our friends the Vermace&rsquo;s.  One for my January term class on the west coast, and finally a bag full of ski gear for the rest and relaxation trip to Breckenridge.  Since leaving home I have travelled a bit over 10,000 miles.  My means of travel has included several flights, two long train trips on Amtrak, some time in a car, and lots of time on public transportation.</p>
<p>In the last 35 days I&rsquo;ve had more experiences than many people would have in a lifetime.  I say this out of a sense of gratitude, and to remind myself how lucky I am.</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve body surfed in the Pacific Ocean on the beach in front of our rented house in Mazatlan called the Sand Castle.  Calling the Sand Castle a house is a bit of an understatement.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been deep sea fishing, and reeled in a large Dorado (Mahi Mahi), which was cleaned dockside, and prepared on the grill at the Sand Castle just hours later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve toasted the New Year watching fireworks over the beach from the fourth floor of the Sand Castle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ec72994d43.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten to know a group of 11 Luther Students well, and watched as they talked with and learned from some of the most successful entrepreneurs in the country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had four days in Seattle to visit Pike Place Market, eat seafood, visit Pioneer Square.  During the same period we visited Amazon, Microsoft, VMWare, and Percognate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/d48e37b72a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Amtrak from Seattle to San Francisco promised spectacular views and a comfortable ride.  While the ride was comfortable, if I did it again, I would definitely spring for sleeper cars for the group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had four days on Fisherman&rsquo;s Wharf, led a bike ride across the Golden Gate Bridge, and beyond Suasalito.  While in San Francisco we visited Strava, Pinterest, Moovweb, Bizo, Sqwiggle, Schwartz MSL, and Hummer Winblad.</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;ve had four days in Menlo Park, including a 32 mile bike ride up Old La Honda road and along Skyline drive.  I introduced the group to turkish food at Sultana restaurant.  While in Menlo Park we spent a day at Google, a morning at SportVision, and learned about patent law at Fenwick West.</li>

<li>The train ride from San Jose to Los Angeles lived up to its billing.  The views were spectacular, and we got to see an amazing sunset over the Pacific.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/bb61fa1b86.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To cap off our trip we stayed in a house called Beethoven&rsquo;s Trio in Santa Monica.  Rather than eating out we were able to use the grill and the kitchen and prepare our own communal meals.  It was fun to watch the students cook (and clean up) and eat in a very casual setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We got to spend the weekend exploring Venice Beach and anything else in the LA area.  Sunday morning I met a group of Chelsea fans at a local British pub.  A fun way to get my soccer fix for the week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While in Santa Monica we visited with Capsule, Coloft, and Fullscreen.  At Fullscreen we were hosted by three Luther alumni two of whom took the Entrepreneurship course and did the journey three four years ago.  It is so gratifying to see your students succeed.</p>
</li>

<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/e23904de2a.jpg" alt=""></p>
<ul>
<li>Finally I&rsquo;ve been able to spend six days &ldquo;recuperating&rdquo; in Breckenridge.  Some might say that five days of skiing is hardly recuperating, and I would agree.  However, we have had 30+ inches of fresh snow in the last three days, and the locals say this is one of the greatest storms ever.  So to say that the skiing has been fantastic is a bit of an understatement.</li>
</ul>

<p>After all of this, perhaps the best thing is that I get to go home tomorrow.</p>

			 <p>The weather report said we had 6 inches of snow overnight.  From the moment we walked out the door it was clear that they had underestimated the snowfall by about 8 inches.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/377008c589.jpg" alt="Powder"></p>
<p>We were on the third chair up at 8:30 this morning.  The steep parts of the hill were awesome, with powder over my knees, floating through the snow.  On the gentle parts of the hill we all formed a single file line in order to get through it all.</p>
<p>By mid-day it was work.  The powder had been packed in many places and it was work to get through it.  The snow continued heavily throughout the day, and we are supposed to get another 14 inches overnight.</p>
<p>This has been the perfect few days of rest and relaxation to finish off January term.  Its even better because we bought the Epic local passes this year, which means we don&rsquo;t feel like we have to ski full time, but can actually just ski until we are ready to take a break, and then ski again later.  Its been great.</p>

			 <p>My daughter Kaia is getting married next summer.  This is not new news, the proposal was made an accepted last June.  But planning is in full swing now, and I was kind of excited when secured a visit with Capsule, because capsule provides a service where all the guests at your wedding can download the capsule app and it will automatically upload all the photos to a special page for the wedding.</p>
<p>This company was founded by Cyrus, who set out to solve a simple problem, a problem we&rsquo;ve been coping with on this course as well.  When you travel, how do you share all your digital photos with the buddies you are traveling with.  When you have a big party?  When you have a wedding, bachelor party, bachelorette party?  Capsule has solved this in a nice, elegant way.  All the photos uploaded for a particular event, are shared with the participants in the event.  Its that easy.  No need to bore all of your Facebook followers with every photo from your trip.  If you&rsquo;re an Instagram user, its super easy to add a special hashtag to your photo and it will be automatically imported into Capsule as well as shared on Instagram.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>What was incredibly interesting for me was to listen to Cyrus talk about business models, and monetizing the service.  Cyrus is not a CS guy, he&rsquo;s a business guy.  Of course as an entrepreneur he can talk the tech talk but his home is on the business side.  Here&rsquo;s an example of how differently we tech people approach a problem than the business guys.</p>
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Each event needs to have a unique id, that can be given to the participants to use to join the event, and/or tag their Instagram photos.</p>
<p><strong>Tech Solution:</strong> Ha, this is easy, we&rsquo;ll just allow people to pick a unique identifier, lets say <code>#TannerAndKaia</code> No problem, this is easy just give them a text entry box, and a quick database lookup to make sure the hashtag hasn&rsquo;t already been taken.  No big deal, even an intern could code this up.</p>
<p><strong>Business Guy Solution:</strong>  Ok, just generate a random hashtag <code>#JK286TJ</code>.  Now if the bride and the groom want to have a nice hashtag for their wedding, we can sell them that as a strategy to monetize the service.</p>
<p>Brilliant!  We tech guys get so focused on the solution most of the time that we never stop to think about simple strategies to monetize.</p>
<p>Our second visit of the day was to <a href="http://fullscreen.net" title="Fullscreen">Fullscreen</a>.  This is a Culver City company that employs three Luther Alumni!  Two of which I am very proud to say are also alumni of this very course.  Drew is employee number 3 of Fullscreen, and Aaron is number 15, Jacob is not far after Aaron.  Fullscreen now numbers over 220 employees, and is a very fast growing new media company.</p>
<p>What do they do?  What do you mean new media company?  Well, this is where my age really starts to show.  Apparently there are people in this world that spend a lot of time watching &ldquo;shows&rdquo; on youTube.  Shows like that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/JennaMarbles" title="JennaMarbles">Marbles girl</a>, or teenagegirl14, and thousands of others.  As Aaron said, this is not your demographic Brad, this is targeted at a group of people that will probably never pay a cable bill.  So Fullscreen is a Network in the sense that they aggregate all kinds of these new generation entertainers, and help them monetize their videos on youtube.  Note that monetize is a euphemism for ad serving, but thats really only a small part of what Fullscreen is about.  Its a great company and Drew, Aaron, and Jacob were excellent hosts.  They even talked their CEO into spending about an hour with us answering questions.</p>
<p>Another interesting story around Fullscreen is that Drew and George (CEO of Fullscreen) met at Coloft Santa Monica.  We were also lucky enough to meet with the founder of Coloft, Avesta, (@avestar). He gave the students  a great no-nonsense talk on his views of entrepreneurship. The story of Drew meeting George is a great example of the synergies that can happen in a co-working facility.  At the time, Drew and a partner were trying to start a little consulting company to do coding for hire.  Avesta happened to be talking to George who was looking for someone with Drew&rsquo;s skill set.  So he introduced the two of them, and a successful company was launched.</p>
<p>I love this story on a couple of different levels.  First, as a professor I take pride in the success and accomplishments of my students even after they leave the campus.  As an alum and faculty member of a college that counts community as one of its defining characteristics, it is great to find other organizations that lift up community as a differentiator.</p>

			 <p>You know those yellow lines on the football field?  They are harder to draw than they look.  Think for a minute about all of the different field conditions.  Natural green turf, artificial turf, mud, snow, cold brown grass.  Now think about all of the different colored uniforms the players wear.  Now, look closely.  The line never covers up any part of a player, or the ball.  Notice that?  The ball doesn&rsquo;t have a yellow strip, the ball blocks out the yellow line.  The same with players shoes.  Today we got to learn about the yellow lines, the blue lines, the down and distance information,  and many more cool effects that Sportvision puts on our television screens.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/650db0f0d3.jpg" alt="SportVision"></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the group on the &ldquo;practice Field&rdquo;  They were moving the blue and the yellow line for us as we stood there. You can kind of see them on the big screen on the wall.  The rack of equipment behind me is what they need to bring to each game, and the computers on the desk are whats used by the operator during the game.  The operator can adjust all sorts of parameters based on field conditions and uniform colors etc.  In addition, in the case of a really bad snow storm, they can also project all the yard markers on top of the snow so the people at home have a better view of the field than the players.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In addition to football, Sportvision is also a big provider of on screen information for NASCAR and Major League Baseball.  In the case of NASCAR they display a box of statistics right above the car as it goes around the track.  For Major League Baseball, they show the ball and strike zone, and a bunch of statistics about pitch placement.  They also collect statistics about every player on the diamond.  They track the ball and the players using an array of cameras placed around the ballpark.  Here&rsquo;s where the cool math and physics comes in.  Based on the flight of the ball, they compute the spin!  The cameras are not good enough yet to track the laces, but with some math, they can provide a visualization of how the ball is spinning!  Very cool.</p>
<p>Sportvision is looking at lots of sports, and looking at newer ways to get more information about every player.  For example Football players may have special chips embedded in their shoulder pads someday in the future.  NASCAR cars already have a special box in them that tracks all kinds of information for Sportvision, Soccer players are not likely to have any special chips as it would likely inhibit their play, unless something could be put in their shoes.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/7983c686b4.jpg" alt="SportVision"></p>
<p>Like most of the companies we have met with Big Data is an important part of Sportvision&rsquo;s  future plans.  Right now their main customers are the television networks, but in the future individual teams will pay for data.  One interesting aspect of the big data strategy for Sportvision is that they don&rsquo;t have to productize the analytics part of it. The reason is because most teams just want the data, and they consider the analytics to be a competitive advantage.  This doesn&rsquo;t mean that Sportvision won&rsquo;t productize some analysis software, because there is a market at the college level and below where teams can&rsquo;t afford to pay for their own data scientists.</p>

			 <p>This is a post I&rsquo;ve been thinking about for a few days.  Its a serious post, but especially after today, its surrounded in humor.  Here&rsquo;s the problem, to me this is funny, but if you had to live with it every day of your life, it might not be funny.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My thinking about this goes all the way back to the first day of JTerm, when we walked, and walked, and walked&hellip; through miles of parking garage to get to the light rail that would take us downtown.  When we arrived downtown, most of us could easily take the escalator conveniently up to street level.  Where we hunted around for the elevator for the rest of the group.  It turns out the elevator is never in a location that is convenient or close to the escalators.</p>
<p>The next day, I led the group into a coffee shop (not a Starbucks) that our host had recommended.  I popped in, looked around, and quickly realized that we couldn&rsquo;t stay, not only couldn&rsquo;t we stay we couldn&rsquo;t all get in the coffee shop.  Stairs only, no ramp.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the Seattle bus drivers were all extremely knowledgeable and courteous.  They were able to quickly help get everyone on the bus, and locked into place for a safe ride, without one word of complaint.</p>
<p>The train ride from Seattle to San Francisco was 23 hours.  It was uncomfortable for most of us, especially when trying to sleep, but it had to be sheer torture for someone who couldn&rsquo;t get out of their chair for the entire time.  Things started to get humorous when we got on the bus outside the Amtrak station.  It was like the driver had no idea how to operate the wheelchair lift!  Hey lets just press some of these buttons and see what happens.  Never mind, the picture diagram of what to do that was posted right there.</p>
<p>When we needed to use the super shuttle to go from San Francisco to Menlo Park, things got a lot worse.  First, the super shuttle has yet to be on time.  Second, even though we ordered an accessible van, the drivers once again clearly had no idea how to make it work.  Luckily by this time our own guys had figured out the general principles of a lift and were able to quickly give useful advice.  The real shocker was our bus from First Student.  All jokes about being on the short bus aside, it blew me away that the driver showed up with a non-functional lift.  He said the battery was dead, but that didn&rsquo;t stop him from randomly pressing buttons while our crew figured out how to operate the lift manually.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/71ee302a25.jpg" alt="Lift Operator"></p>
<p>Its been an interesting process of learning and discovery on our travels, learning to look for ramps and elevators.  Learning to avoid crappy rocky roads whenever possible, and generally feeling a small part of the pain of a comrade that has to put up with this stuff every day.</p>

			 <p>Today we moved south, from Fisherman&rsquo;s wharf down to Menlo Park.  But most of the day was spent at Google.  This was certainly a day that everyone has been looking forward to for most of the trip.</p>
<p>My interest in Google+ was renewed by a great tech talk by Ed Chi.  Who said some very nice things about me in front of my students.  They probably think I paid him.  We heard about supporting an organization as large as Google from Luther Alum Charles Banta, and about i18n &ndash; i(nternationalizatio)n from Luther Alum and former CS faculty member Craig Cornelius.  Yes there are 18 letters between the parenthesis!  We had a fabulous tour of campus, a stop in the 3D printer lab, time at the gift shop, and of course, lunch at Charlie&rsquo;s Cafe.</p>
<p>You have probably heard about Google&rsquo;s famous slides, but they also have fire poles for people that want to quickly get down a floor.  And, in case you don&rsquo;t want to walk between buildings they have these cool Google Bikes all over the place.  Guests are encouraged not to ride the bikes, but nobody said anything about posing with one for your picture.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/c262284074.jpg" alt="Google Bike"></p>
<p>The other talk we heard was from Brian, a member of the self driving car project, who gave us a quick overview of the Google X Chauffeur Project.  The technology is interesting, and I have to admit I hadn&rsquo;t really thought past the cool sensors, and modeling that would be required.  But, what is even more interesting are the many social implications of self driving cars.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Brian pointed out a couple of interesting facts for us to consider.  Most people dedicate more space in their homes to their car or cars than they do to their own children&rsquo;s living space.  He also asked us to think about all the cars in the parking lot outside the office we were in.  What fraction of the time are those cars in use?  Are they parked 90% of the time?</p>
<p>What if our self driving cars could take the kids to school in the morning, and then return a while later to bring us to work?  What if we could just bring up our smart phone and request a self driving car to pick us up at work and drop us off at home.  We might not need such large garages.  Could we turn much of our driveway space into gardens?  Would this mean the end of rush hour?  Probably not, but if the car was self driving, could a self driving car pick up you and a couple of friends on a logical path to work and drop you off?  On the freeways would traffic flow more fluidly if the cars could talk to each other and the automated sensor systems were good enough to ensure a nice safe drive with cars spaced out 10 feet apart?  A self driving car has no need to slow down and gawk if there is an accident.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/08adec5109.jpg" alt="lexus"></p>
<p>Would we collectively own fewer vehicles if our car could be called to pick us up with the touch of a button on our smart phone, or automatically scheduled to pick us up based on our daily calendar?</p>
<p>The big car companies will say that self driving cars are 30 years in the future.  The researchers at Google feel like we are more like 5-10 years from reality.  Who is better situated to make that call?  The companies with the navigational, and sensor technology, with access to smart phone interfaces and calendars?  In short a company like Google?  Personally, I&rsquo;m rooting for Google on this one, and can&rsquo;t wait to buy into my first self driving car collective.</p>

			 <p>&ldquo;Ann is on a roll, we are going to be late.&rdquo;  I texted to Phillip.  Indeed she was.  Ann Winblad was the first investor in my Company, Net Perceptions, back in 1996.  She was an investor, a  mentor, and a supporter of us for years.  Today she was giving my students a lesson in the new economics and ecosystems of software development.  <em>I</em> was taking notes as fast as I could to keep up with the stream of new companies and technologies that were <em>must know</em> things according to Ann.</p>
<p>After the lesson she opened up the floor to questions, and the stories began to flow.  And flow, and when the students stopped asking questions she asked them questions and told them stories about their answers.  We were long past the end of our scheduled time, and I noticed her long term assistant Katie, standing across the room arms folded, glaring at Ann.  Heaven only knows what poor entrepreneur was downstairs sweating while she was entertaining us!</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ann repeated a number of themes we&rsquo;ve heard throughout the trip.  One I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve mentioned here but we have heard from several people:  <strong>Don&rsquo;t sweat your first job.</strong> or Your first job is just your first job, so don&rsquo;t worry about it too much.  This is such a change from when I graduated from college, and I think its a real shock for midwestern students to hear.  But I think it is true.  We tend to think of that fist job as a real important commitment whereas the truth is it is a chance to get experience for 2-3 years and then to help you really decide your direction.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m not sure I agree with is Ann&rsquo;s assertion that 90% of sofware will be assembled from already existing components.  This may be true for some companies, but it seems to me that <em>real</em>, <em>big</em>, breakthroughs are still going to come from creating new and innovative components for other people.</p>
<p>This is continuing a trend/theme that we have picked up on in this trip, but that may also be a bit troubling.  1.  It is so much cheaper for a software company to get off the ground these days.  Amazon AWS, is just one contributor to this, Sonatype is another.  2. Automated sales and marketing software is yet another.  Gone are the days when you need a big face to face sales force to sell enterprise software. 3. The result of this is that VC&rsquo;s are able to make bets on software companies for a relatively small amount of money.  The downside is that they may not be investing in the riskier, bigger companies that may result in really big breakthroughs.</p>
<p>For my own, and your convenience, here is a list of words of wisdom and interesting companies to check out:</p>

<li>
<p>You need to know Atlassian, Github, and Sonatype</p>

			 <p>The following is a republication of a post I wrote for Luther College&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.luther.edu/ideas-creations-blog/">&ldquo;Ideas and Creations&rdquo; Blog</a>.</p>
<h3 id="changing-the-world-understanding-entrepreneurship-january-2014">Changing the World: Understanding Entrepreneurship, January 2014</h3>
<p>I have never been so glad to leave Minnesota as I was on January 6th.  The temperature outside was -24 with a windchill that defied all logic.  I was headed for Seattle with 11 Luther students to begin my course on &ldquo;Understanding Entrepreneurship.&rdquo;  I really enjoy traveling with students.  Their energy, their enthusiasm, their ability to eat a <em>doughnut burger</em> at the airport before getting on a three hour flight.</p>
<p>Our itinerary for the three-week course includes four days in Seattle, an overnight train ride, six days in San Francisco, four days in Silicon Valley, a continuation of the train ride to Las Angeles where we will conclude the trip.  Notice the nice progression of temperatures, from -24 in Minneapolis to 48 in Seattle to 68 here in San Francisco today, to even warmer in LA.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The goals of the course are for the students to meet with people from a variety of companies, from early stage startups to very successful large companies, and everything in between.  We’ll meet with technology companies, Venture Capitalists, Public Relations folks, managers, programmers, you name it.  The point is for the students to hear stories.  Sometimes the most interesting and valuable stories are the stories about failure.  Sometimes they are about success.  Almost always they are a combination of the two that demonstrate passion, persistence, and the willingness to take a risk.  The students are from a variety of majors including CS, management, accounting, marketing, and communications.The mix of majors creates good discussion, and questions from a variety of perspectives.</p>
<p>Some of the companies we have visited you have probably heard of:  Microsoft, Pinterest, Google, and Amazon. Many of the people we have talked to at those companies are veterans of smaller companies that have ended up in a large company.  Some of the companies we have visited you maybe haven&rsquo;t heard of, and may never hear of:  Sqwiggle, Moovweb, Strava, Capsule, and Fullscreen.  Some of these smaller companies are still in the &ldquo;garage phase,&rdquo; they are just a couple of people with a great idea and a huge amount of passion to change the world.</p>
<p>I have connections to many of these companies from my former life as a software entrepreneur, but what is even more exciting is that I am connected to some of these companies by former students, and other Luther Alums.  What a great experience it is for the students to see Luther Alumni, here on the west coast, doing great things.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/9a224e0392.jpg" alt="Dan and John, Two smart guys"></p>
<p>The students all have their own reasons for taking the course.  Some want to see if the West coast is right for them. Some want to learn about the different job opportunities in the high tech area. Some are exploring.  Some are looking for an internship for next summer at that one cool company.</p>
<p>It is the passion, and the willingness to take a risk on something you believe in that I really hope they take away from this course.  Too often, our Lutheran midwest culture teaches us that failure is bad, something to be ashamed of.  What they hear in Silicon Valley is that not trying is far worse.  Everyone here has stories about failing.  One, two, three or more startups that never made it.  The reasons are as varied as the people.  Something like 90% of newly started companies are not successful.  But, people learn from their mistakes, move on, and do something new, sometimes they do something great.  Always, they are trying to make a difference.  If they learn nothing more than that, the course will be a success.</p>

			 <p>Curiosity is the cure for boredom.  There is no cure for curiosity.  We began our day with a visit to PR firm, Schwartz MSL, Bryan Scanlon gave the group a great overview of the players in the PR space and how PR companies work.   The tagline for their group may be something like &ldquo;telling stories that matter.&rdquo; I like this and it resonates well with a lot of the career advice people are sharing with the students.</p>
<p>In fact Bryan told a great story about his brother that really helped emphasize the message that you have to find a real world outlet for your skills and then use your skills to develop something real, something that you can tell a story about.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Bryan&rsquo;s story was that at an interview for an engineering job his brother was asked to glue together two PVC pipes.  A pretty practical, maybe even mundane, task for someone applying for an engineering job.  However his brother took stock of the situation and said he couldn&rsquo;t do it.  &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the interviewer.  &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have any cleaning fluid&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;without cleaning fluid I can&rsquo;t do a proper job and the joint won&rsquo;t last.&rdquo;  He was hired.</p>
<p>Lunch time was great as Gage, Dylan, and I went to an Irish pub called Irish Times.  The outstanding feature of this pub is that they had the Arsenal game on all of the TVs during lunch today.  The arsenal were taking on Aston Villa, in a game we needed to win to retake &ldquo;top of the table.&rdquo;  In a stroke of good luck I got to see both Arsenal goals before we had to take off for our afternoon meeting.</p>
<p>The afternoon meeting was at Hatch Today, a co-working space that houses many many small companies.  We visited for over an hour with Eric, one of the co-founders of Sqwiggle.  Eric is young, energetic, has a thousand side projects going, and is the epitome of young founders here in the area.</p>
<p>The software that sqwiggle produces is somewhat like Google Hangouts, but the video is only in black and white and only updates every 10 seconds, unless you are actively in a conversation with a co-worker.  The idea is you can have sqwiggle on all day, without using a ton of bandwidth, and your fellow workers can see when you are in your office.  If they need to have a quick conversation, they just double click on you.  This allows for good interaction in a company that is totally distributed.  Sqwiggle is a great example of such a company.  One founder is in the UK, one in San Francisco, and one of their developers is Luther alum Cam Webb, currently in Atlanta, but soon to move to Des Moines.  I think many of us were skeptical of the idea until we met with Eric, saw it in action, and learned a bit more.</p>
<p>Many of the themes we&rsquo;ve been hearing about were repeated by Eric this afternoon, but I would like to highlight one that has not been mentioned yet.  <strong>Measurement</strong>  Eric showed us the company dashboard.  Very cool, how many user, how many paying users, how many active users, revenue per month.  All great metrics to run the business by.  In addition he talked about other metrics they are collecting relative to the details of the software.  This is a really important lesson.  If you want to really improve something, you need to measure it.  For example, bandwidth usage, number of active users in a conversation, you need to set goals, and then work on designing your software to meet those goals.</p>

			 <p>What a great day for a bike ride!  We rented some bikes at Blazing Saddles, right next to the hotel.  Then took off for the golden gate bridge.  It was a beautiful day and no surprise, the bike paths were very crowded with all kinds of people enjoying the outdoors and the scenery.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/0619f9a8c9.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>About half of the group above rode across the bridge and back.  Here is me leading the pack.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/88d20bf699.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The other half followed me further on into Sausalito, with the goal of making it to Muir Woods.  The second half of the trek started off very nicely with a long downhill.  which was quickly followed by a steep uphill.  All well and good until my riders started to figure out that &ldquo;what goes down must be climbed back up!&rdquo;  The ride flattened out through Sausalito and beyond so it was a nice easy ride for a while.  But it was getting to noon, and we&rsquo;d already ridden about 12 miles.  I misunderstood the directions from the bike shop and thought we had about 12 more to go.  So, since the guys all had tickets to Alcatraz and had to be ready to board by about 3:30 we decided to turn back short of our goal.  It turns out we were much closer and could have made it to the redwoods!  Bummer.</p>
<p>In any case, we rode just over 25 miles, and it sure felt good to be on a bike outside again!</p>

			 <p>A 23 hour train trip?  At some point that seemed like a really charming idea.  Eight hours in, I&rsquo;ll say that the bloom is off the rose.  Its been a nice ride, and a good chance to catch up on some reading and blogging but for the most part its just a long ride on a train full of people.  The views have been OK, but it is now dark outside.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>What?  There is no real way to know the answer to this question, but it is one that was posed to the group today.  How do you handle uncertainty?  How do well do you think on your feet?  This is a typical interview question used by many high tech companies.  At Luther we might ask prospective faculty, &ldquo;how many cornstalks in the state of Iowa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This question definitely stumped a few people in the room, but others got the idea quickly.  This question isn&rsquo;t about getting the right answer.  There is a right answer, but nobody could tell you exactly what it is.  There is definitely a wrong answer:  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Its not possible.&rdquo; are two examples of the wrong answer to this question.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So what do you do?  You have to make some assumptions.  What fraction of the state of Washington is forested, what is the density of trees in the forested area.  If you use some reasonable numbers for those two items you can make a reasonable, and defensible estimate.  That is something that startups have to do every day.  Use the information they have available, and make their best guess.  Check the assumptions, and be ready to refine the answer.  This is not just true of startups, it is true for all businesses, projects, and life.</p>
<p>Here are a few more highlights and themes from today:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you interview, have a story.  I&rsquo;ve been telling my students this for the last several years, but it is much more compelling when you hear it from someone who is actually making hiring decisions.  The story should be based around something you have built or designed yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can have the best technology and still fail in many different ways.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the one core competency of your company?  Starbucks was not coffee, it was training, so that customers had a consistent experience.  McDonalds was not making burgers, but rather distribution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, it takes four kinds of people to make a successful startup:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Visionary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Builder</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Designer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Closer</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One person may take on multiple of these roles, but you have to have them all in order to be successful as a company.  The Visionary is of course the person who is looking ahead five years and setting the direction.  The Builder, owns the solution space.  Builders are part of a spectrum.  Architects &ndash; Hackers.  Architects want to have a good strong lasting implementation, and tend to plan the whole system out before coding.  Hackers, tend to code as they think, and the best of them have an idea coded by the end of the meeting where it was first introduced.  Where are you on that spectrum?  The Designers interpret the vision to the builders, they own the problem space, and understand the user experience.  In the best case, the builder and the designer are the same person.  Finally, the Closer, usually a sales person, often also the CEO is the person who can close the deal.</p>
<ul>
<li>The better a company is at serving their customers, the less likely the are to change.  This of course goes against every lesson Steve Jobs and others like him taught us.  You need to make yourself obsolete before someone else does.  In an aside, I think this lesson right here is the achilles heel of higher education.</li>

			 <p>Jeff Bezos likes to talk about technology and civilization and where we are at in terms of the analogy that we are still at &ldquo;Day One.&rdquo;  He recently observed that we are so early in Day One that the alarm clock hasn&rsquo;t even gone off yet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With new technologies, it’s very tempting to think that you’re further along than you are. But usually, you’re more primitive than you think. My guess is we’re still pretty primitive. We as a society, as a civilization. I doubt we have figured out the new technologies very well yet. At Amazon, we’re doing our part in trying to push things forward, but I have the feeling it’s Day One.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so it was that we found ourselves in the building called Day One South, meeting with our very gracious host Sam. This was a great way to start, and although Sam had not been prompted in any way about what to say, he hit on some of key themes for the students to take away from the course:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Passion</strong> &ndash; You are going to work long hours, so you want to find a place to work and a job to do at that place where you are passionate about whatever it is.  If you aren&rsquo;t excited about it, keep looking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Culture</strong> &ndash; This part of the discussion brought back both great memories and ulcers in my stomach from the days when Amazon was a Net Perceptions customer.  I&rsquo;ve never been pushed harder than I was by Jennifer Jacobi (JJ) when she was my primary contact at Amazon.  She challenged us, held our feet to the fire, threatened to dump us, and ultimately helped us create a better product.  Apparently this is how Amazon treats all its suppliers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Risk</strong> &ndash; High tech companies are full of risk takers.  Sam was no exception as a young graduate who simply moved to Seattle in search of a job.  Years later he is still at Amazon.  Many more years later than he expected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/5380/2022/ac6f201a99.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>After our meeting with Amazon we found a coffee shop where we could take over a large table and had some group discussion.  I told my own story of Net Perceptions, which I should probably write down here soon, and tried to relate my own experience with the themes I want the students to look for over the next three weeks.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Today was a big day.  The Microsoft mother ship.</p>
<p>We began our visit with an hour in the Envisioning Center, this is Microsoft&rsquo;s take on the future, 5 years out.  There was some pretty cool stuff in there.  If you&rsquo;ve ever drooled over the fancy table on Hawaii Five-O where they can flick things from phone to table, table to screen, etc. You have a pretty good idea of where Microsoft thinks the workplace of the future is headed.  I&rsquo;m there, I want it.  I&rsquo;m already imagining myself walking into the classroom, iPad in hand, and flicking a copy of where we left off last class from my iPad to the board.  Wait, thats a bit of a mixed vision, I&rsquo;m pretty sure they were surface pads, not iPads.  But you get the idea.</p>
<p>After the Envisioning center we moved to another of the 128 buildings on the Microsoft campus where we had time to have our daily group meeting and book presentation.  We were escorted by Tina Wang, and she joined in to the discussion of Sara Lacy&rsquo;s Once you&rsquo;re Lucky, Twice you&rsquo;re good.  Tina works as part of Enwe&rsquo;s group, but is the only one here in the US.  After our lunch we had a really fun talk with Neil Leslie, who shared a lot of wisdom with the group.  And finally Dave Maltz joined us for a final hour on scaling up the data center.  Its fair to say that by the time Dave was done everyone had soaked up about as much information as is possible for brain to take in one day.</p>
<p>A couple observations.  This is not the Microsoft of the 90&rsquo;s.  The Microsoft that I knew and worked with at Net Perceptions were, well, to be blunt, they were bullies back then, because they could be.  I get a real sense that is gone.  Instead they talk of change, how they need to compete, and if you&rsquo;re comfortable, you shouldn&rsquo;t be there.</p>
<p>Returning to key themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Passion:  I don&rsquo;t think I need to say more about this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects:  I&rsquo;ve told my seniors this for a few years now, but it has a lot more credibility coming from an outsider.  You need to have a project to show when you go to interview.  Bring an app you have built on your phone.  Show a website you have developed on the browser.  Be prepared to talk about the challenges, trade-offs, and succeesses you have had in developing your project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linked In:  This is a critical tool for finding a job.  If you are a CS junior or senior and have not created a LinkedIn profile.  Do it now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Failure:  We heard a lot of stories about failure today, and we will continue to hear of them.  Startups, started and &lsquo;buried,&rsquo; products and projects that failed and never saw the light of day.  The most important message, that I hope students get from this trip, and talking to a bunch of successful people, is that failure is OK.  <strong>Fail Fast</strong>, and learn from your mistakes.  It is a cliche to say that you learn more from failure than success, but it is true.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the evening it was fun to unwind with our first group dinner.  We met up with recent Luther Alum Jake Nowosatka at Cutters Crabhouse.  Its at the far end of Pike Place Market.</p>

		<a href="https://reputablejournal.com/2013/11/04/160000.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2013-11-04 19:00:00 -0500">Nov 4, 2013</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This is the text from my chapel talk yesterday.  The video (mostly of the top of my head) can be found on the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Luther Portal<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  Make sure you go to the On Demand tab and look for me on November 4.</p>
<p>I’m going to begin today with a slightly different opening litany than we have become accustomed to:  When my friend Ann Highum asked me to switch days with her I said “sure”  after all one days reading can’t be that much harder than another.  Then I got the email from Pastor David.  It contained three very ominous words:  “these troubling texts”.  Not to mention that our reading today is from the book of Nehemiah.  Lets begin with our reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On that day they read from the book of Moses in the hearing of the people; and in it was found written that no Ammonite or Moabite should ever enter the assembly of God, 2 because they did not meet the Israelites with bread and water, but hired Balaam against them to curse them—yet our God turned the curse into a blessing. 3 When the people heard the law, they separated from Israel all those of foreign descent.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, discrimination, xenophobia, that sounds troubling enough to get started.  We’ll come back to versus 23-31 in a moment.  This is not your typical sunday school reading.  Who are the Ammonites or the Moabites?  What did they do to deserve getting kicked out?  I think we might need a bit of context.</p>
<p>Now it turns out that the book of Nehemiah is essentially a blog written by Nehemiah himself, who was the cupbearer for King Ataxerxes.  So I thought as a public service I would try to give some context to todays reading by condensing Nehemiah’s blog posts into a series of tweets.   A sort of Twitter translation of the bible with commentary from yours truly. Nehemiah himself goes by @cupbearer21 in case you want to follow him on Twitter later today.</p>
<h3 id="posts-from-the-month-of-chislev">Posts from the month of Chislev:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Brother Hanani came to Susa today, brought visitors from Judah</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OMG the wall of Jeursalem is broken and the gates destroyed by fire!  #JerusalemFire</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been weeping, fasting, and praying for days.  Still distraught over the fire in Jerusalem.  #WoeIsMe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next, we get some insight into the incredible guilt and potentially inflated sense of self importance that @cupbearer21 must feel:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can’t help but feel that the #JerusalemFire is my fault!   Me and my family must have offended @God.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="now-we-skip-to-the-month-of-nisan">Now we skip to the month of Nisan</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>AtaXerxes told me to buck up.  I guess he can tell I’m still sad over #JerusalemFire</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just days later we get the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Holy career path! @ataxerxes granted my request to go to Judah and rebuild the walls of Jerusalem!   #ClimbTheRoyalLadder</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now to be sure that he does not encounter opposition on the journey he tweets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If anyone doubts me here’s a link to letters from @ataxerxes granting me safe passage and timber from the royal forest.  #TheKingsGotMyBack</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Nehemiah’s glee is short lived, just days later we learn:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Curses! @TobiahtheAmmonite is not happy with me. He will try to foil my plans for rebuilding the wall!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ahh, so we have a bit of dramatic foreshadowing on this deal with the Ammonites.  Our story continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Snuck out tonight to inspect the walls on my own.  #ThisPlaceIsAMess</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the inspection, its time for the work on the walls to begin in earnest, but Nehemiah needs workers so he tweets out a plea for help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Join me! we are going to rebuild the walls!  The hand of my God is gracious!</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code> To which there are hundreds of replies of the form @cupbearer21 count me in!  @cupbearer21 tools ready to go, The hashtag #RebuildTheWalls was definitely trending that day.
</code></pre>
<p>But not everyone was on board with Nehemiah’s plans:  @SanballatTheHoronite and @TobiahTheAmmonite and @GeshemTheArab who basically responded</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@cupbearer21 WT——H</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>@cupbearer21 Who do you think you are? Are you rebelling against the King?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, Nehemiah we can tell work is proceeding by the status updates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>High priest @eliashib doing good work on the sheep gate</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Sons of @hassenaah rebuilt the fish gate today</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so on with tweet after tweet of progress from around the city.</p>
<p>Of course in typical twitter flamewar fashion we see some retweets from our old friends @SanballatTheHoronite and @TobiahTheAmmonite</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ha!  what are these feeble Jews doing?    Do they think they can rebuild the wall in a day1?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And from Tobiah,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That stone wall they are building — any fox would break it down!  #I’llHuffAndI’llPuff</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which Nehemiah replies</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh @God, do not blot out the sins of @Tobiahtheammonite  #FireyPitForYouDude</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some days later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Big day today!!  Walls back to half their original height!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But even with all of that progress those darn Ammonites stirring up trouble again.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emergency! We need families NOW to guard the walls against @sanballat and his ilk.  #NeedMoreSpears.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And although you might think I&rsquo;m making this one up, Nehemiah has been so busy that he tweets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m starting to smell, its been weeks since I put down my spear and changed my clothes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After all that, Nehemiah shows that he is a guy who can get things done.  After just 52 days he tweets</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At last, the wall is done!  #PartyAtMyHouse</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the wall rebuilt, Nehemiah gets an interesting assignment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From @God:  Hey! @cupbearer21, You should use your analytics and do a genealogical and demographic analysis of the people</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point there are several chapters of names of Levites, and prophets and lineages of various families.  Clearly ancestry.com could have saved a bunch of time.</p>
<p>So, rebuilding the wall is clearly the signature accomplishment of Nehemiah,  But even with all of his success as governor, Nehemiah doesn&rsquo;t take advantage of food and land allotments that were allowed him, because there was already such a great burden on the people.  He also made the other nobles and officials forgive all outstanding debts and ordered them to return all land and money that had been taken as taxes so the people would be able to feed themselves and their families.  To keep everyone happy he organizes covenant day which is summarized in the following tweet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Covenant day!  #TithingIsGood  #OfferingsRock #FirstBornSonsToGod #FirstOfEverythingToGod</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which brings us again to Chapter 13 and these troubling tweets:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Much reform is needed @Elishib and @Tobiah have made a mess of things  #NoMixedMarriages #KeepMarriagePure</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Kicked out the foreigners  #KeepTheIsreaelitesPure  #PureJerusalem</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in what must have felt like the ultimate victory for old Nehemiah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I chased @Jehoidia son-in-law of @SanballatTheHoronite away! He is gone from the city!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which I now might imagine a response out of the future:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From @JCSofG,   Wait, What!? No No No!  #EatWithTaxCollectorsAndSinners!  #BadNehemia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, does our story for today all come down to Nehemiah getting his revenge on the Ammonites for trying to thwart his efforts to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem?  It sure sounds like it. The sad thing is that In many ways this story seems all too familiar.  Take out Nehemiah and Insert the name of your favorite ruler:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Humble beginnings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Great accomplishments and rise to power</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Power goes to the head</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stupid policies</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whats maybe more interesting to me is why this particular verse is the verse for the day, with all of the good things Nehemiah did, why highlight this one idiotic policy? Maybe simply to remind us that tolerance is a good thing even when times are tough.</p>
<p>I’ve spent a lot of time this last week trying to answer the question, where’s the grace in this story? I think maybe for us and for Nehemiah it really does come down to his final tweet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember me @God for the good I have done!</p>
</blockquote>

			 <p>Its been a great J-Term.  A trip to Vail for some Skiing, <strong>and</strong> a trip to Florida to solve the worlds problems with great friends at the DeBary Institute.  For those who do not know, the DeBary institute is a newly renowned think tank with roots in the Bone Lake Global Institute.</p>
<p>We arrived on Friday and spent a wonderful late afternoon enjoying the hospitality and home of our host, Tim Peter.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>The culinary highlight of our trip was dinner at the Swamp House Grill and Tiki Bar.  We enjoyed some lovely alligator bites as appetizers:</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Dinner was provided by Gregory and Brad who made a charming seafood alfredo.</p>
<p>Monday morning we left the house at 5:50AM.   The temperature was 62 degrees.  Five hours later we arrived in Cedar Rapids where the temperature was -2.  Thats a big swing for a monday morning.</p>

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>been thinking about for a while now, and so I’m going to go ahead and impose a</p>
<p>measure of accountability on myself by proclaiming this publicly.  This week, I’m</p>
<p>starting a series of educational blog posts here, and as a part of my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Runestone</p>
<p>Interactive<!-- raw HTML omitted --> publishing project.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>everyday problems, or puzzles. Hopefully these little projects will be interesting</p>
<p>and will give learners motivation to dig into the details of the solutions.  I</p>
<p>will provide links to the relevant Python programming constructs and data types in</p>
<p>either of the two interactive books (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->How to think like a computer scientist:</p>
<p>Interactive Edition<!-- raw HTML omitted --> , or</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) This will let me</p>
<p>focus on the problems, and not the minutia of the language.  Lets face it, reading</p>
<p>about all the different possible string methods is not that exciting, but seeing</p>
<p>them in action, and then wondering about what else you might be able to do with</p>
<p>strings is OK.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>manner its pretty easy to follow even if you don’t know all the details.  So, that</p>
<p>is my intention.  Write a solution and do it in straightforward Python that</p>
<p>beginners can understand.  Each project will appear over several days, and</p>
<p>will likely include some homework related to the project.  I’ll provide the solution</p>
<p>in a followup post.  In addition, I may refine the solution over the course of</p>
<p>several days introducing more and interesting solutions or more advanced features</p>
<p>of the Python language.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Bently called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Programming Pearls<!-- raw HTML omitted --> In John’s columns he would feature a particular</p>
<p>problem or algorithm, and present it in a straight forward way, but then he would</p>
<p>refine that solution again and again polishing it until he had an incredibly</p>
<p>elegant solution.  It was beautiful because even a novice programmer could</p>
<p>understand what was going on at the start of the article, but would get sucked in</p>
<p>to the beautiful solution and would learn more than they thought possible.  While</p>
<p>advanced programmers might chuckle at the initial solutions, even they would have</p>
<p>to admit that they learned something by the end of each column.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>to start fairly easy with some string and list kind of projects, and work my way up</p>
<p>to more complex problems and algorithms, again this is meant to be educational so</p>
<p>that in theory a beginner might read through these posts more or less</p>
<p>chronologically, and learn some computer science along the way.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>How do you know you have an enduring friendship?  When after more than 27 years as friends, and seven days of traveling together you can play Euchre &ndash; couple against couple &ndash; and still be friends at the end of the train ride from Seward to Anchorage.  Now you might think that a simple card game means nothing, but there a few members of our party of 4 who are a little on the competitive side.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The controversy in this story came after our third missed bear siting on the train.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a bear up ahead on the left side of the train&hellip; No now its on the right&hellip; no, now its on the left&hellip;&rdquo;  This is some kind of weird plan by the conductor to get the train rocking back and forth, or something to get the people in the back cars of the train to drink more.  So, here it is dear readers, as we are all in a state of frustration over bear sitings, the up card is a heart, I&rsquo;m holding three diamonds (but no bowers).  Everyone passes, and it comes back around to me.  I bid diamonds.  This is when the trouble starts.  As it turns out, Holly has both red bowers and only passed because she had better diamonds than hearts.  Needless to say we get set, and I launch into some kind of self righteous tirade about &ldquo;maur passing&rdquo; just to set us.  This scenario plays itself out three times again over the course of the train ride&hellip;  Now last night I might have said some mean words about Holly&rsquo;s card playing ethics, but today in hindsight, and in the spirit of type 2 fun, I can see that I might have been overly harsh in my judgement.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The card playing on the train was the culmination of a long day.  The last day of a cruise is always a long hard day.  For one thing, I think thats one of the things that all cruise lines suck at.  You are an awesome person who must be waited on and pampered at every turn, until the last morning of the cruise.  Then you yesterday&rsquo;s news, who must get up early and off the ship as soon as possible, so your room can be turned over to someone new and wonderful who must be pampered at every turn.   Or maybe I&rsquo;m just grumpy that I&rsquo;m not the new wonderful person anymore.  In any case we love cruising and its ability to allow you to see great places in the world, all the while knowing that you have a safe comfortable place to eat and sleep each night.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We spent our day on a Kenai Fjord tour.   We had another day of wildlife sitings.  The new animals we saw today included Dahl Porpoises and up close views of Puffins and Stellar Sea Lions.  The tour company was really good, it was Major Marine Tours.  Its not the largest tour company in the marina but the service can&rsquo;t be beat.  When we got out into open ocean areas and the swells got large they were especially kind to the large number of people at the back railing &ldquo;going for distance.&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I post this picture of the sea lions &ndash; whose population has been declining for the last several years &ndash; I am reminded of one especially redeeming quality of the day.  SUN!! This is the first day since we left Minneapolis that we&rsquo;ve had a sunny day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After a long day, we arrived at the Anchorage train station at 10:30 PM.  We got our luggage and the hotel shuttle picked us up for our ride to the hotel.  Holly and I transported all of our bags to our room, while Jane and Brian stayed on the shuttle to go to the airport to get our car.  We lucked out on the emerald aisle and got a good sized Dodge.  At least its big enough to hold all of our luggage and all of us.  We had envisioned a number of scenarios in which we stored our luggage at the hotel while we went North to Denali.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As I write this we are in our room in the Mckinley Creekside Cabins.  Its not quite the same as our cabin on board the ship, but as Gabe would say, in Alaska, &ldquo;Warm and Dry is more than you can hope for&rdquo;  We had a pretty good drive in the rain to get here, including a swell stop at the liquor store in Wasilla, and some fake pictures of where we imagine Sarah Palin might have lived.  We got our tickets for tomorrows bus tour of Denali and then spent some time visiting with the sled dogs of Denali.  We took the very scenic Rock Creek hiking path back to the visitors center and then headed out to Prospectors Pizza for a delicious meal.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tomorrow will be another long day of hiking and bus riding as we go in search of Bear and Moose here in Denali National Park.  We are hoping for another clear day so that we can see Mount McKinley.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alaska<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>I mentioned type 3 fun in a previous posting, and although there was plenty of type 1 fun to be had in Icy Strait I&rsquo;d like to begin this post with a little description of some type 3 fun.  As a reminder, the definition of type 3 fun is something that is lame when you do it, and remains lame and not fun even in the retelling.  Thus was our bike tour of Hoonah.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I should start out by saying that it is not the fault of the bike tour guide, or anyone else involved with tours at Icy Straits.  We signed up for the bike tour / zip line combination tour through the cruise line because that was the only way we could sign up for a zip line tour in the afternoon.  The idea of an eight mile bike ride sounded appealing, a bike tour is a great way to see an area at a faster pace than walking, and is a nice way to get to know an area better than you do in a tour bus.  but, the simple truth is that Hoonah is a nice small fishing town in Alaska, but there really isn&rsquo;t that much to see.  So, we saw the ferry terminal (3-4 ferries per week), the office bar, the seaplane dock, the library, the post office, and the airport.  Oh yeah, and it was RAINING yes  really really raining.  We were absolutely soaked to the bone through our pants and jackets and everything.  Yuck!  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We all agreed that what we should have done was just not ride the bikes.  We could have stayed at the visitor center for a while staying warm and dry and then gotten on the bus to the top of the zip line.  Our mistake.  So, yes a wet cold bike ride through a town of 800 is virtually the definition of type 3 fun.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But, lets leave that in the past and talk about the highlights of our day in Icy Strait.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It began in the morning with our whale watching adventure.  We had booked a small tour with a private operator.   I would highly recommend that everyone does this.  The small boats are so much more nimble, and you get to know some of the local people in a way that you can&rsquo;t when you are on a big boat with 100 other people.   So it happened that there were only six of us on the boat with captain Floyd.  We had plenty of room to spread out and we were not vying for position with other people when the whales showed up.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As whale watching trips go, this one just couldn&rsquo;t be beat.  We were not even out of the harbor before we were treated to a humpback bubble netting.  Bubble netting is one feeding strategy used by the humpacks.  They circle under the water making tons of bubbles that confuse the smelt to the point where they don&rsquo;t know which way is up.  Then the whale swoops in from below with mouth wide open and scoops up hundreds of gallons of water and fish.  The whale closes its mouth and strains out all the yummy fish through its baleen.  Here&rsquo;s a picture of the first whale we encountered.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, of course, anyone who has ever been on a whale watching trip has seen lots of whale tails.  As the humpbacks typically come up, show their hump for a while, and then dive deep.  When they dive deep they do so with their tail straight up in the air.  What most people do not get the opportunity to see first hand is a humpback breaching.  This is when the whale propels its whole body out of the water.  This is an amazing feet for an animal that averages 40 feet in length and weighs about 1000 pounds per foot of length!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We were lucky enough to see several such breaches.  I was lucky enough to have my camera pointed in the right direction when this one happened!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, we were in for one more bonus.  Orcas!  Its pretty rare to get to see Orcas on a whale watching trip!  After watching the humpbacks for a while our captain informed us that there were Orcas in the area.  This is another great example of the benefit of going on a smaller ship.  The captain can just take off and follow the whales you want to see.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here are two Orcas from the small pod we were following.  For a while we thought we were going to see the death of one of the sea lions swimming perilously close to this group, but I guess they were not hungry at the time.  The dorsal fin in the picture above is about six feet tall!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, the whale watching was awesome, but our final act of the day was also a  real blast.  The worlds longest, highest, fastest zip line!  Its a one shot ride from the top of the mountain outside of hoonah, down to sea level.  This was  really a stretch for Holly, who is a not a lover of heights, but the ride was fun.  Unlike other zip lines, this one actually has a harness that allows you to sit quite comfortably.  You don&rsquo;t have any brakes to worry about as that is taken care of for you at the bottom by Physics.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the top of the zip line you brace your feet against the starting gate, six people at a time, and then they count down from three.  The gates open and you are off.  In our case we started out in the clouds, flying downward.  Suddenly you are out of the clouds and the ship and the water all come into beautiful view right in front of your eyes.  In just about 90 seconds the ride is over, but its a real thrill.  I&rsquo;ve got some great video from the head mounted camera, but I&rsquo;ll have to wait until I get home to edit that and post it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hoonah, AK<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Our guide for the Mendenhall glacier trek told us that there are 3 kinds of fun.  Type 1 fun, is just &ldquo;fun fun.&rdquo;  Its good while its happening and afterward you remember it as fun.  Type 2 fun is the kind of thing where you do something and even though you might be totally exhausted or in pain when its all over you remember it later as being an awesome thing to do.  Type 3 fun, is no fun at all, it sucks when you do it and it doesn&rsquo;t get any better in your memory over time.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yesterday was all about Type 2 fun. Today was 8 hours of hiking, rock scrabbling, and walking on the glacier.  The last two and a half hours of hiking were in pouring rain.  But already, just one day later we are remembering yesterday as an awesome day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We left the ship at 8:15AM to meet our guide, Gabe, who drove us out to the trail head.  Gabe had backpacks for us with our glacier gear in them, a hiking pick axe, a helmet, a harness, and crampons.  Also some light snacks.  We were in our Alaskan layers of Dry Fit, Kuhl Fleece, and North Face.  To this we added rain pants and a rain jacket.  There was a light rain falling at the beginning of our hike, but that stopped somewhere along the way.  The hike starts out pretty easy, and gets gradually more difficult the closer you get to the glacier.  There was one point where we were truly climbing up the rocks next to a small waterfall.  It was great, but it wasn&rsquo;t easy.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After only a half a mile, people were stopping to shed layers of clothing like crazy.  We continued this process for a good portion of the hike.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After two and a half hours of hiking and climbing over rocks we were really getting close to the glacier.  With Gabe&rsquo;s help we did some estimating on where the glacier would have been the last time we were in Alaska.  It was really interesting to take a picture from that point and to see how far it has receded.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We took a short break to get our glacier gear unpacked and to gear up for our trek on the glacier itself. About this time it started to rain a bit harder, and it even looked like a few snowflakes by the time it hit the ground, so we cooled off very quickly while we were getting ready.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the glacier,  we found some cool blue ice holes and practiced walking with our crampons.  Then Gabe asked if we would like to try some ice climbing.  Why not?!  The vacation has been injury free so far so we might as well try something new.  This was really a blast even though it was just a short little climb to get the hang of it.  Ice climbing involves driving your crampons straight into the ice wall, while hanging from two pick axes.  Of course we had a safety line so we wouldn&rsquo;t fall, if we lost our grip.  It was really fun but took a lot of effort.  Brian and I made it all the way to the top, and Jane and Holly both made a good run at it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At this point we had been hiking and on the glacier for about three and a half hours.  We knew we had two and a half more to get back so we were just about at the point to say it was time to head back, but Gabe had one last surprise for us.  He took us over to the side of the glacier where we took off our crampons and hiked down to a spot where there was a cave.  We hiked right inside the glacier.  There was a little stream flowing into the glacier, and the ice was really amazing.  Overhead the ice was glowing blue from the light filtering in from above.  On the sides it looked like polished metal, which was because the ice was dirty and there was no light coming in from that direction.  The idea of being inside this glacier, with the blue glow all around us made the whole day worthwhile.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When our spelunking was finished it was time to pack up our gear into the backpacks again and head back.  By this time our feet were dead tired and the rain was coming down very steadily.  Up until now the day had been all type 1 fun, but a two-and-a-half hour death march back to the car in the rain turned it into type 2.  One fun little bonus on the trip back was that we saw some salmon swimming up one of the small streams.  After catching them and seeing them jumping in the ocean it was interesting to see them heading up stream.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We got back to the ship, and headed to the hot tub.  That did wonders for our legs, but we were so tired we didn&rsquo;t even bother to dress for dinner in the dining room, we just threw on some clothes and went to the buffet.  I believe this may be a first for us in skipping dinner in the dining room in favor of the buffet!  Holly was sound asleep well before 10:00, I went to the magic show, and along with Jane made it to 10:30.  Gone are the days of partying on the ship until midnight or after I guess.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Its a lazy, rainy afternoon here in Ketchikan Alaska.  We are back from fishing and have warmed up with some lunch and a nice soak in the hot tub. The ship should be pulling out of port any minute now and we&rsquo;ll be on our way to Icy Strait. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The last 24 hours have been a lot of fun.  In terms of a sea day, yesterday would have to rank way up there for the unique experience it provided us.  As you know from my previous blog post I can&rsquo;t say much about it.  We were  part of a very familiar kind of scene to those of you who actually watch this particular kind of show.  Meaning we were a part of a large group that got to try out some wonderful food and then share our thoughts.  Whether or not we&rsquo;ll ever be seen by millions of people is all in the hands of some editor at this point.  But I know I&rsquo;ll look forward to this episode.  It will always remind me that Holly does not know what Jamie Oliver actually looks like, since he wasn&rsquo;t here.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Last night we had our second phenomenal  dinner in Qsine.  This is the restaurant that features the iPads,  we were rewArDed by seeing someone faMous at the tAble next to us.  We didn&rsquo;t intrude on her privacy since she was having dinner with her family and celebrating her father&rsquo;s birthday.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This morning we were up bright and early for our fishing expedition.  It was just the four of us and captain Bob.  Bob was a great captain, he&rsquo;s a salty dog that has been guiding fishing trips here in Ketchikan since the 1970s.  We had a lot of fun fishing for salmon, even though it was a bit on the cold and rainy side.  The high for the day was about 57 degrees, and we had rain off and on.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course we had to turn even a small fishing expedition into some kind of a competition.  Although as competitions go this was pretty tame since we took turns reeling in the fish.  At the end of the morning we had 14 fish in the hold.  All of them nice pink salmon, that we&rsquo;ll look forward to receiving via Fed Ex when we get back home.  Here&rsquo;s Holly and Captain Bob netting one of our first salmon.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And here&rsquo;s Jane<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tonight we are looking forward to eating in the main dining room, and relaxing at one of the shows on the ship.

			 <p>Good morning from stateroom 7199.  I&rsquo;m looking out the back of the ship at a lot of very low hanging clouds.  We are in a &ldquo;family view&rdquo; stateroom, which means that we have one of the largest decks of anybody onboard.  It is perfect for this Alaskan cruise as we can see both directions and even have a great forward view.  When the ship is moving we can sit out on the covered part of the deck where we are sheltered from the wind.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yesterday was a really fun day.  We woke up in our two room suite at the Executive Hotel in Vancouver.  Jane and I walked the two blocks down to Tim Horton&rsquo;s to get coffee, bagels and donuts.  The plan for the day was to shop for wine, water, and soda to bring on board.  With shopping complete the next activity is to rent bikes and ride around Stanley park.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->As we headed out for our shopping Holly realized that she was missing her tongue scraper!??  What the heck is a tongue scraper?  Brian and I were full of extremely unhelpful suggestions for what might substitute as a tongue scraper.  My suggestions of Emery boards or repurposed floss were particularly unhelpful since I had no idea what one should even look like.  When Holly did finally describe one to me, it seemed perfectly reasonable that a spare plastic zip tie would work.  Many pharmacies later we found one, and all was well with the dental hygiene world.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I must say the neighborhood we were shopping in was a bit sketchy.  We passed by several very interesting sex shops, one featuring mannequins dressed in thongs fighting with light sabers.  We tried to convince Holly that we had seen tongue scrapers inside the adult book store, but she didn&rsquo;t go for it. The liquor store we were going to opened at 9:30 and it was quite an interesting study in humanity.  People were literally waiting outside the door for the store to open.  When the iron gate of the front door was finally unlocked there was a rush inside for people to buy their first drink of the day.  Needless to say we were left alone in the fine wine section of the store.  We found a nice selection of British Columbia wines to try including some very interestingly named varietals.  Hatfield&rsquo;s Fuse, Quails Gate, and Sandhill.  As we checked out with our bottles to take aboard, the guy ahead of us in line was literally shaking to pay for his two beers and get out the door so he could pop one open.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->With all of the shopping behind us, we returned to the hotel, where we were granted a late checkout time of 12:30.  This worked perfectly for our bike ride.  The bike rental place was just around the corner.  Vancouver is an extremely bike friendly place.  There were great bike lanes that took us from the bike rental place to the pier area and then around the park.  It was really beautiful.  Although it wasn&rsquo;t a workout pace it was a fun ride, and a good way to get to know the city a little better.  We will definitely come back someday just to spend some time in and around the city.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->With the bike ride complete we ordered a taxi and headed to the pier.  As we were going through the customs line we were joking with one man who was sent to the much shorter line for &lsquo;the film crew.&rsquo;  Yes, much mystery surrounds this first night on the ship.  Our reservation in Qsine had to be changed at the last minute because of a filming for a &lsquo;food related show.'<!-- raw HTML omitted -->We of course pumped this guy for information, but he couldn&rsquo;t tell us anything.  I even tried the old, &lsquo;blink once if its Alton&rsquo; line but he just laughed and headed through customs.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Later in Qsine we had a really great time with the wait staff and the maitre de.  We said, OK, look we know something is happening because they changed our reservation, so who is it?  Whats going on?  Finally, a member of the staff, who identified himself as James Bond, agreed to the you guess and I&rsquo;ll nod game.  I got the person and the show right on my second guess.  For which we were rewarded with an invitation to dinner at Qsine again tonight where we may be part of the taping.  We will have to sign non-disclosure agreements, so although I would love to reveal the name of the show, I can&rsquo;t.  I will say that this could be at the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Top<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of my list for exciting happenings aboard the ship.  If I get to meet a celebrity <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Chef<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that would certainly be a highlight of my amateur culinary life.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad	<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Inside Passage, enroute to Alaska<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>I can see the campus from my house, its about a 20 minute walk, all downhill for the first half of the trek, then slightly uphill the rest of the way to the Olin building.  I&rsquo;ve always thought that biking to work would be the way to go, but I hate getting home all sweaty and gross.  The problem is the uphill trek.  From the River to My House is about a 300 foot climb over the course of just under a mile, a 6% grade for those who care to know.  But trust me, its steep.  It takes a lot of work to get up to my house, even on my road bike.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->But, awhile back I was reading about some of the new electric assist bikes, and I thought hey, I haven&rsquo;t bought a new bike in a long time.  So, I started doing a bit more research and decided that one of the Trek Ride+ bikes would be great.  I ended up with the Trek FX+.  Sadly, my local bike shop can&rsquo;t sell the Ride+ bikes, so I had to go to La Crosse to find this one.  The good news is that this is a good time of the year to get a new bike!   30% off was the sale today.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I took it for a ride around LaCross and up the only little hill I could find,  the Cass Ave Bridge, not much of a hill, but I knew I was on to something when I felt like I was riding on the flats with the wind at my back, when I was actually going up a little hill.  After riding it around downtown a little longer I went back to the shop, smitten.  The only decision was which panniers to get so I can haul groceries and my stuff to school.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jane hasn&rsquo;t ridden it yet, but I have the feeling I know what she&rsquo;ll want for Mothers day.  This would be the perfect option for our cycling marriage.  I could ride my road bike and she could ride the electric assist.  I think I see some longer bike rides together in our future :-)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The other great thing is that no gas is required.  Its all battery operated, and as I coast down the hill the battery is recharged.  I&rsquo;lll be able to easily cruise my way to school, and then on the way home I can engage the electric drive at the bottom of the hill, and get the assistance I need to climb up to my house.  I won&rsquo;t arrive home sweaty, and I&rsquo;ll have the satisfaction of knowing that I got a few extra minutes of exercise, and didn&rsquo;t use any gas!  The only downside is that I&rsquo;ll be only inches away from the Whippy Dip as I ride home, but as long as I can get by there I&rsquo;ll be fine.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>I love it when a good plan comes together.  Last summer we decided to finally take the plunge and build a pizza oven at the lake.  After looking at the options to site the oven, and thinking about a fireplace/oven combination, we finally decided to combine the pizza oven project with our desire to replace the aging and increasingly ugly outdoor bar area.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->In late June I contacted a few different stone masons to start to get an idea of cost and availability.  I was immediately impressed with David Marek <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.layersofstone.com">www.layersofstone.com</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> and his ideas on the project.  I checked some references and decided that my initial impression was correct, that David would be a good guy to work with.  Here&rsquo;s his original sketch of our project.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->David was able to start tearing out the old bar, and working on the replacement the last week of July.  He just finished the project last week, in time for us to enjoy some Pizza with our friends this last weekend.  The result was beyond my expectations.  Here&rsquo;s a photo of the final outcome that you can compare with the plan:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For more shots of the project you can check out my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Flickr Photo Set<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Last saturday was the inaugural pizza baking.  It took about two hours to get the oven fully up to temperature, but the wait was well worth it.  We used this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->crust recipe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and pre-baked the crusts on both sides for just a few seconds.  The crusts came out very light and crunchy.  I&rsquo;m looking forward to trying out lots of different crust recipes, but this was definitely a winner.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Now that I&rsquo;m back from traveling in South America I&rsquo;ve started on a project to add a turtle graphics module to skulpt.  Skulpt is a javascript implementation of Python written by Scott Graham, and is available on skulpt.googlecode.com.  Its a very nice project because it allows you to embed a Python interpreter right in your web page.  I&rsquo;ve written about how to do this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in a previous post.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The skulpt interpreter works like a charm, but it does not yet have any of the Python standard library modules implemented.  Scott has been working with wrapping some of Googles closure libraries, and has a webgl module too.  But none of your regular Python friends are available, things like math, random, turtle, etc need to be implemented.  For the most part these things are already available in javascript so the work is in creating the module and then wrapping the underlying Javascript inside the standard Python API.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Where to start?  There&rsquo;s not a lot of documentation provided for skulpt, so I&rsquo;m hoping this post will be enough to help others get going a bit quicker.  Scott was very helpful in responding to all my emails so this is not a criticism of him, rather I&rsquo;m hoping this will save him the effort the next time someone wants to extend skulpt.  So, here&rsquo;s the deal.  skulpt relies on two javascript files the first is skulpt.js  and builtin.js  A very minimal installation only uses skulpt.js, whereas if you want to use any modules they are in builtin.js.  Looking around the distribution you will not immediately find skulpt.js because you need to build it. You get a sculpt.js file by using the m script that comes with the distribution.  running m &ndash;help will give you the full list of commands, but the two that you probably most care about are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->m dist<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->m docbi<!-- raw HTML omitted --> The dist command builds both skulpt.js and builtin.js  docbi builds builtin.js and puts a new copy of it in the doc/static directory.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lets begin with a quick tour of the source tree:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->src<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - contains the implementation of the Python interpreter<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->src/lib<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - has the module implementations of webgl and goog.  This is where turtle will live and any other modules I implement along the way.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->doc<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - This directory contains a google app engine application and is what you see on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->skulpt.org<!-- raw HTML omitted --> There are a couple of important files to check out in here.  One of them is doc/static/env/editor.js  This is the code that ties together the interactive editor on the home page with the skulpt interpreter and the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->codemirror<!-- raw HTML omitted --> editor.  If you know how to build a google app engine app then this directory makes sense.  One thing about the home page is that it is not set up to use any of the modules.  The modules are used in the more advanced ide, which you can find in doc/ide/static.  I&rsquo;m going to tell you how to add modules to the simpler editor later in this article.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->test<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - this directory contains a bunch of files for testing the implementation in a batch mode.  These tests are run whenever you run m dist, or m test.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->dist<!-- raw HTML omitted --> - This directory gets created and populated when you run the m dist command.  It contains the built and compressed versions of skulpt.js and builtin.js<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To illustrate how to make use of modules, here&rsquo;s an extended version of my earlier hello world style example.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;html&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;head&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;script src=&ldquo;skulpt.js&rdquo;

1) {<!-- raw HTML omitted -->     return 1;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> } else {<!-- raw HTML omitted -->     return n * myfact(n-1);<!-- raw HTML omitted --> }<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    }<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    mod.fact = new Sk.builtin.func(function(a) {<!-- raw HTML omitted --> return myfact(a);<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    });<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->    mod.Stack = Sk.misceval.buildClass(mod, function($gbl, $loc) {<!-- raw HTML omitted --> $loc.<strong>init</strong> = new Sk.builtin.func(function(self) {<!-- raw HTML omitted -->     self.stack = [];<!-- raw HTML omitted --> });<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> $loc.push = new Sk.builtin.func(function(self,x) {<!-- raw HTML omitted -->     self.stack.push(x);<!-- raw HTML omitted --> });<!-- raw HTML omitted --> $loc.pop = new Sk.builtin.func(function(self) {<!-- raw HTML omitted -->     return self.stack.pop();<!-- raw HTML omitted --> });<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    },<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    &lsquo;Stack&rsquo;, []);<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->    return mod;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->}<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->All modules start out with the $var builtinmodule = statement.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->This test module exposes a single method to the outside world, called fact, There are a couple of key functions for building up a module.  The Sk.builtin.func   call for adding functions to your module, and the Sk.misceval.buildClass method.  This test module defines a simple factorial function called fact, and a class called stack.  Here&rsquo;s a simple Python program that exercises the module:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->import bnm.test<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->print &lsquo;starting&rsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->print bnm.test.fact(10)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->x = bnm.test.Stack()<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->x.push(1)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->x.push(2)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->print x.pop()<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->print &lsquo;done&rsquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Its not obvious, but the buildClass method takes four parameters:  globals, func, name, bases<!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems that you always pass the mod object itself as the globals parameter, the func parameter is a function that represents the class object, the Name is the external name of the class, and bases presumably would be if the class is inheriting from another class.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Sk.builtin.func method creates a function.  For module creation we typically only have to worry about the one parameter, func, which is the javascript implementation of our Python function.  The method can also take a globals object and two closure objects.  Look at the comments in function.js if you want more explanation of how the builtin.func method works.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, I think this should be enough to get you going.  Its worth repeating, if you made it this far, don&rsquo;t forget to call m docbi or m dist after you make changes in your module, its easy to get into the mode of thinking that the new javascript is automatically loaded.  But builtin.js is not automatically rebuilt!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ll consider this post a work in progress, please leave a comment if something is unclear or you would like something explained in more detail.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Its the last day aboard ship, and it has been a day of mixed emotions.  We are excited to get back to our friends and family in Decorah, yet we have had so much fun on this cruise, and we have actually met some great people as well.  Some of these people get to stay on the ship for the next leg of the cruise and as we think about our long day tomorrow and our overnight flight we are a bit jealous that we don&rsquo;t get to go through the Panama canal, and then fly home from Fort Lauderdale.  I&rsquo;m amazed that I could even consider staying onboard for another two weeks, but we&rsquo;ve learned that its really all about pacing (note to self, next time do not buy the unlimited drinks package.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The cruise critic message boards really provide a great service.

			 <p>We have great table mates this cruise!  Kim and Rico from Houston, Shyla and Yogi from Ohio, and Rachel and Howard from New Jersey.  We look forward to sharing stories of our day with them each night at the late seating.  This is worth remarking on because we have seldom had good luck with our dinner companions.  From the guy from Hutchinson who kept asking me &ldquo;you gonna eat that?&rdquo; to Marge (not sure thats her real name) from Jersey (definitely sure she was from Jersey)  who complained every night.  Here&rsquo;s a sample of one conversation:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Marge:  They never have any good soup on this cruise!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brad: What kind of soup do you like?<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Marge: Cream of Mushroom<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Brad:  Well, we had that last night<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Marge (exasperated): But I didn&rsquo;t order it last night!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->This sort of luck has continued for us cruise after cruise, until this one.   Except for the cruises we have taken with our great friends Brian and Holly!  Anyway since it is just the two of us on this trip, we are grateful for the companionship.  Now lest you think this post is going to be about dinner and our waiter, I&rsquo;m going to shift gears and tell you about our day.  We were in Puerto Madryn, but the excursion we had planned was a trip to the Valdez Peninsula.  This was an excursion that we booked outside the ship through Forastero Tours.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->We were among the first 20 people off the ship this morning, wanting to get ahead of all the big tour busses that were heading the same place we were.  We met our guide and driver on the pier and hopped in their car.  Our guide introduced himself &ndash; I&rsquo;m not going to tell you his name, because I&rsquo;m convinced he will be an excellent tour guide someday and I don&rsquo;t want what I&rsquo;m about to relate to you to harm him in any way &ndash; and proceeded to tell us that this was his first time leading a tour, and that he was still studying for his certification as a guide.  He also hoped his english was good &ndash; it was passable.  The next thing he should have said was, &ldquo;so you&rsquo;re in luck, your tour today will be half price!&rdquo;  But that isn&rsquo;t what he said.  In fact he didn&rsquo;t say all that much, period.  He did tell us that there are four main economic industries in Puerto Madryn, The Aluminum factory is number one, something, something, and then tourism.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, its a long drive from the port to our destination on Peninsula Valdez, about 169km in fact.  The other interesting factoid about this part of the world is that the ecology around Peurto Madryn is steppe or steppe-like?  A large unforrested region of grassland.  This was a combination of small shrubs and sand.  In other words there is really nothing interesting to see on this drive, except for the occasional Guarananca or Piche &ndash; but I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself.  Well, not really, there were two destinations for todays trip.  First, the San Lorenzo Penguin Colony, and second Punta Norte Sea Lion and Elephant Seal colonies.  Oh yeah, the last 76km to the Punta Norte are on gravel road.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->So after riding most of the way in silence, we are approaching the Penguin colony and our guide says.  &ldquo;In a few moments we will be at the penguin colony, here is a penguin&rdquo;  At which point he pulls out a picture of a penguin.  He continues:  &ldquo;Penguins are black and white, with a white band up here (pointing to the white band on their head) and a black band here (pointing to the black band).  I think both Jane and I were struggling to keep a straight face at this point, but one of us managed to say &ldquo;interesting.&rdquo;  Of course what he didn&rsquo;t know is that this was &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; in the Iowa/Minnesota sense of the word.  Here concludes the fascinating section of the commentary on penguins.  To summarize:  They are black and white and have two bands.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let me add a bit more detail that I learned on my own, and from the lecture given by the naturalist on board the Infinity&hellip;  The penguins that we were about to see are called Magellanic Penguins, named for Magellan who sailed these parts back in the late 1500&rsquo;s.  Maybe now you are getting a sense for the title of this post? Ferdinand?  Ferdinand?  anyone? anyone?  Yes, Ferdinand Magellan!  I&rsquo;m so clever.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->I know I&rsquo;m sounding a little snarky about the tour today, but it really turned out just fine.  because we were just the two of us on our own tour, we got to the Penguin colony well ahead of the masses, in fact we had the place all to ourselves, and that made it worth it right there.  Would I have liked some more insightful commentary?  Sure.  But the kid was sincere and earnest so its hard to be too upset with him.  If I&rsquo;m upset with anything its with Forastero tours for sending us a rookie.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, without further ado, here are some penguin pics for you!  yes, we were up close and personal with the penguins.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This little guy was not happy.  I think he was hungry and Mom was not coming through.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After the Penguins we continued further up the road to Punta Norte where we saw both Sea Lions and Elephant Seals.  Punta Norte is the only place in the world where you can see the Elephant seals.  At other times of the year, and at high tide, you also stand a chance of seeing an Orca coming into try and catch a baby Sea Lion, but no such luck today.  Anyway, here&rsquo;s a shot of the beach, you can see the Sea Lions down below.  the Elephant seals are way on the far right end of the coast here and we could see them with the binoculars, but not so well with the camera lens.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After watching the Sea Lions we found a nice place to sit and enjoy some sandwiches for lunch.  While we were eating lunch the friendly neighborhood Armadillo (piche en espanol) came around hoping we would share with him, or her Im not sure how you tell with Armadillos.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The last and final episode with our young guide happened on the way back to the ship.  We had to take the exact same route back to the ship that we followed to get to Punta Norte, but lets just say the ride seemed shorter for some people than for others.  Yep, he actually <!-- raw HTML omitted -->fell asleep<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on the ride back!  I think the driver was ready to reach across, open the door and push him out.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Its funny how all of our excursions involve both a driver and a guide.  In each case we are led to believe that the driver does not speak english.  In this case I&rsquo;m pretty sure the driver was much more experienced than the actual guide, as he seemed to know many of the other guides at Punta Norte.  Furthermore I think he understood and probably spoke english just fine.  He also did an excellent job of scanning the countryside and the road ahead for interesting animals.  We could tell that he was the one who would spot them and then tell our guide what was coming up.  His job today was to give junior some feedback on his first outing.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure he got an earful!<!-- raw HTML omitted -->The day ended on a very positive note.  Jane got on a roll at the craps table and ended the night over $400 ahead.  She made a lot of other people at the table very happy too.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m sitting here watching the sun come up over the city of Punta del Este.   The water is perfectly calm except for the waves created by some of the tender ships taking the earliest of early passengers over to the pier.  There are plenty of clouds in the sky today, but there is still the occasional blue patch.  We are close enough to shore that we can see the beaches spread out in all directions.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->We don&rsquo;t have anything planned for today except to tender ashore and walk around for a bit.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yesterday we were in Montevideo, we had arranged a tour with Marta along with a group of people from the cruise critic message boards.  It was a driving/walking tour of the city, along with a stop at the Bouza Winery just outside the city.  The winery is only about 10 years old, which is about the average age for wineries in Uruguay.  Since it is getting toward the end of summer here they were just starting the harvest, so we got to see some of the equipment they were using for squashing and processing the grapes.  There were also a lot of very ripe grapes on the vine.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here is the aging room where they age some of their wines.  Some of the barrels are made of french oak, and some of american oak.  The winery is pretty scientific about how they keep track of which batch of wine comes from which section of the vineyard.  They also keep 20 bottles from every harvest for every different kind of wine they make.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After the tour, of course we had to do a tasting. We had a white blend, along with a rose, a merlot, and a red blend.  We asked to try their Chardonnay and their Malbec, unfortunately they only had the chardonnay left for tasting; it was good but I actually liked the white blend we tried originally better.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->After the tasting, we were all tired&hellip; Big surprise right!  But we had a little more touring left to do.  We climbed montevideo&rsquo;s only large hill where we were treated to a great view of the harbor and our ship.  Its right in the middle of the photo below.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overall it was a nice tour.  Last night was the first formal night on the ship, and it was fun to get out the old tuxedo again and enjoy some good food and a nice show, iBroadway.  Jane and I can both check frog legs off the list of foods we have tried.  Guess what?  They taste like chicken.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve recently been looking for ways to run Python in a browser.  There are lots of reasons why I think this is a cool idea.  For example, creating some simple tutorials, Making some online quizzes and tests, getting Python to run on my iPad&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It looks like there are two projects that are actively working on solving this problem.  The first is called skulpt  (see the demo on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->skulpt.org<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.)  This project actually reimplements the core of Python in Javascript by hand.  They are working on some modules, but right now it is basically the core Python language.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The other project uses <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Emscripten<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to compile the CPython C source code to javascript!  Yep you read that right.  You can see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->here<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that the core of Python 2.7 is running.  You can import sys, but thats about it.  Nevertheless both of these are really useful for beginning Python exercises.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The problem with both of these is that right now there is no user level documentation.  Skulpt is particularly difficult as you can&rsquo;t even look at the demo page to see how its done.  You need to go digging through some additional source files from the distribution to figure out how to make it work for yourself.  The source code of the syntensity page is pretty easy to follow.  So here&rsquo;s a hello world program using skulpt.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;script src=&ldquo;skulpt.js&rdquo; type=&ldquo;text/javascript&rdquo;&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/script&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;script type=&ldquo;text/javascript&rdquo;&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->function outf(text) {<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   var mypre = document.getElementById(&ldquo;output&rdquo;);<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   mypre.innerHTML = mypre.innerHTML + text;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->}<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->function runit() {<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   var prog = document.getElementById(&ldquo;yourcode&rdquo;).value;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   var mypre = document.getElementById(&ldquo;output&rdquo;);<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   mypre.innerHTML = &lsquo;';<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   Sk.configure({output:outf});<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   try {<!-- raw HTML omitted -->      eval(Sk.importMainWithBody(&quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;,false,prog));<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   } catch (e) {<!-- raw HTML omitted -->      alert(e);<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   }<!-- raw HTML omitted -->}<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/script&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;h3&gt;Try This&lt;/h3&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;form&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;textarea edit_id=&ldquo;eta_5&rdquo; id=&ldquo;yourcode&rdquo;&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->print &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/textarea&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;button onclick=&ldquo;runit()&rdquo; type=&ldquo;button&rdquo;&gt;Run&lt;/button&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/form&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;pre id=&ldquo;output&rdquo;&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Its a bit on the verbose side, and it could certainly be improved so that less code would have to be replicated if you wanted to put multiple input/output areas on a single page, but as a learning example I think it works OK.  The try/catch block around the Sk.importMainWithBody function call will capture Python runtime errors and throw them.  This is a nice way to inform your users of syntax errors in any code they are trying out.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m certainly no expert in either implementation, I just offer this post as an example and a time saver for anyone else trying to get going with either implementation.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

I suppose its not really your fault, and as a loyal Apple customer its much easier for me to blame AT&amp;T than you.  Still, it makes me sad to have to tell you this.  I waited as long as I could for AT&amp;T to expand their network in my direction. I&rsquo;ve hung on every Verizon rumor for two years.  Finally after enduring a year of carrying my iPod touch in the same pocket as the mind numbingly horrible Motorola Crush I bought an HTC Desire yesterday.  Android!! I never thought I would see the day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s whats even worse, I like it!  It has some great apps Gmail, Calendar, and many apps that I already love on my iPod Touch and iPad:  Dropbox, Evernote, 1Password, Kindle, Facebook, Twitter, Weather, Stocks, and a 5, yes 5, megapixel camera!  I already love the gps, so the location aware apps work, I love the WiFi and the Bluetooth.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;m going to miss OmniFocus, but I carry around my Ipad almost everywhere I go so I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll miss it that much.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So Apple, I&rsquo;ll remain a loyal customer, at least for now.  I&rsquo;m going to continue to develop my app for the iPad, I still love my iMac and my MacBook Pro.  But if US Cellular comes out with a decent family data plan in the next month or so you may lose two more sales as the rest of my family follows me into the smartphone world.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>So today I sat in my office and looked over at my library of books, probably about 700 books all together.  The top half of the library contains my cookbook collection and lots of other non-fiction books.  The bottom half is largely science fiction, some paperbacks that I&rsquo;ve had for 30 years,  The Lord of the Rings trilogy for example.  There were also several large stacks of books on the floor because the shelves are full.  Jane is wanting me to do something to get the books off the floor.  Even though she doesn&rsquo;t spend that much time in my office so I don&rsquo;t know why it bothers her, but she&rsquo;s right the piles have been accumulating and its time to do something.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Suddenly it hit me, I could let all of the paperbacks go.  I&rsquo;ve been saving them for years because they are my favorites and maybe I&rsquo;ll read them again, or maybe I just like to look at the shelves and see my old favorites sitting there. I&rsquo;m not sure what the precise reason is, whatever it is I&rsquo;m over it.  I just realized that if I did want to read them again, I would no longer want to do it by holding a real book in my hand.  I realized that just like all of my old &rsquo;80s music that I had on cassette tape these are relics of my past, and if I did want to read them again I would be happier to download them to my iPad and read them in the kindle app or iBooks.  But, fat chance that the iBooks store would have any of these old favorites.  I prefer the iPad over the dedicated Kindle because it saves me one device.  Plus until now the kindle required cell coverage that I don&rsquo;t have.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, here, for posterity, and maybe to remind me in the future if I come back and read this post instead of staring at bookshelves, is a random walk through the lower half of my library. If you have suggestions for what I can do with the paperbacks let me know.  If you read this list and have suggestions for other authors you think I would like, definitely let me know.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rober Sawyer, every book ever written by him except for the current WWW series which I bought in electronic form from the beginning.  Factoring Humanity, Calculating God, the Hominid Series, great ideas<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Isaac Asimov, The robot books, and the entire foundation series.  These books took me through college.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stephen R. Donaldson, the Thomas Covenant Chronicles.  Covenant is still one frustrating guy whenever I think about these books.  Although I notice that there are some new additions to the series that are out in eBook form&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dan Simmons, the Hyperion, Endymion series.  The Shrike was one scary monster.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->David Brin, Despite the absolutely dismal movie the Postman is still a favorite in how it forshadowed the web.  I also have some Brin on the upper half of the library, The Transparent Society is an excellent book to get you thinking about privacy in the digital age.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Orson Scott Card, the Enders Game series&hellip; I loved all of these books, and I even like some of the more recent ones where he goes back and fills in some missing pieces from the perspective of other characters.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Connie Willis, The Doomesday Book is awesome as are many of her other stories although none have captivated me as much as that one.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Frank Herbert, The Dune series of course.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Robert Heinlien, Stranger in a Strange Land and others.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mary Doria Russel, The Sparrow.  This is one of my all time favorite books, in fact I even made my Paideia students read it last year.  I&rsquo;m sure they thought I was off the deep end for making them read Science Fiction in a serious class like Paideia but Oh well.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Robert Russo, not science fiction but a great writer.  I like all of his books, but teaching at a small college, I get tears in my eyes from laughing so hard when I read Straight Man.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And speaking of non-science fiction books, Jon Hassler, this guy captures small town midwest living so well.  From Staggerford to Rookery Blues they are amazing.  I miss him, and I miss Connie Helgen who recommended him to me.  After our trip to Ireland this summer I&rsquo;ve been longing to go back and read a Green Journey again, but I just checked and its not available in the Kindle store.  Horrors!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->James Halperin, The Truth Machine, and I just read an article this morning about a group out in california that is using MRI as a new lie detector.  Anyway, read this book.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Roger Zelazny, the whole Amber Series, kind of a disfunctional family but the whole series is fun to read.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Grisham, hmmm why did I save all of these??<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Carl Sagan, Contact.  I read this way before the Jodi Foster movie.  That was just a bonus for a young geek who loved her in the after school specials.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->J. R. R. Tolkien, a boxed set of the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings.  I don&rsquo;t think I can part with these.  I still remember reading these late at night with a flashlight under my blanket.  I&rsquo;ve still never been able to make it through the Silmarillion though.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Douglass Adams, such a loss, The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series.  I swear I can open up any of these books to a random page and start reading and I&rsquo;ll be laughing in no time.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Neal Stephenson, Snow Crash and Cryptonomicon.  I&rsquo;ve never had the energy to make it through the Quicksilver books, but I have Anathem on my iPad so we&rsquo;ll see.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Gordon R. Dickson, Dorsai, the Chantry Guild, The Final Encyclopedia<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Larry Niven, the Ringword Books, and other books with Jerry Pournelle (a Mote in God&rsquo;s Eye)  I still remember looking forward to reading Pournelle&rsquo;s Chaos Manor column in Byte magazine every month<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Robert Charles Wilson, Spin, Darwinia, The Chronoliths, and others.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Vernor Vinge, A Fire Upon the Deep, a Deepness in the Sky<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ursula K. LeGuin, The Dispossessed, and the Earthsea books.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Mary Stewart, The Crystal Cave series that retells the legend of King Arthur.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also discovered a rather interesting section on the shelves devoted to historical fiction, but I&rsquo;ll leave that for another time.  I just wanted to mention it in case you&rsquo;ve concluded that I&rsquo;m hopelessly one dimensional.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would also say that I&rsquo;ve discovered that computer science reference books work very well as ebooks.  I&rsquo;ve been teaching myself to program my iPad and I have several good references in electronic form.  Its nice to have them open on my big screen, and its easy to find examples when you can search.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>So I&rsquo;m working on an app during my sabbatical that has an iPad component and an online Google App Engine component.  The Google App Engine part is half web based and half web service based.  Of course this means that the local client part has to be able to authenticate itself to the Google App Engine before it can communicate and do useful stuff.  Finding good reliable examples of how to do this is surprisingly hard.  For the Objective C code I&rsquo;m working on I found a nice set of classes that do the trick for you here:  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On Github<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  For Python I found some example code on <!-- raw HTML omitted -->stackoverflow<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  However it was not really in a reusable form.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The basic outline of what you have to do is as follows:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->1.  Login to <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ClientLogin">https://www.google.com/accounts/ClientLogin</a>  This will give you an auth token.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->2.  Use the token you gained in step 1 to login to your Google App engine application or service.  When you have successfully logged in to your service google will set an ACSID cookie for you to use when you make subsequent requests to your service.  This prevents you from having to login each time you make a web service request.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I&rsquo;ve taken some ideas from both places mentioned above and have created a Python class for logging in and accessing app engine services from Python.  To use this module you just need to import it and create a GoogleAppEngineLogin object.  Once the object is created you can use the open method on the object to access further services.  The open method is just a convenience wrapper around urllib2.urlopen but it also makes sure that your cookie has not expired before it makes a request.  If you have comments or suggestions for how to improve the code please let me know via email or leave a comment.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The code is reproduced below, but you can also just download the file from git clone <a href="mailto:git@gist.github.com">git@gist.github.com</a>:36b1c45ed39298178907.git<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->import getpass<!-- raw HTML omitted -->import urllib<!-- raw HTML omitted -->import urllib2<!-- raw HTML omitted -->import cookielib<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->class GoogleAppEngineLogin(object):<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    &ldquo;&quot;&quot;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   Logging in to an App Engine Account (when you use google users) is<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   a two step process: First you must login to Google generally.  This<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   gets you an auth token.  The auth token is used as part of a<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   request to login to your app/service During the login process for<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   your app/service the server sets a cookie with the name of ACSID,<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   it is this cookie and its value that serves as the authentication<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   token for your own service/app.  So, for future requests you need<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   to give the server the cookie as part of your request.  Handling<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   cookies can be a bit tricky if you haven&rsquo;t had some experience with<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   it but luckily Python&rsquo;s cookielib module makes it all pretty<!-- raw HTML omitted -->   automatic.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->    This class takes care of the whole login process for you, and then<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    gives you a simple helper to access the URLs for your service.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    The helper function makes sure the cookie is still valid and<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    passes on the request along with the cookie.  Technically you<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    would not even need to use the helper function, you could use<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    urllib2 directly to access your service but this seems a bit<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    neater to me.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->    Some of this code was inspired by and lifted from an example on<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    stackoverflow.com, but that was all in-line code my contribution<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    is to add some error handling and encapsulate the whole thing<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    inside a class to make it easier to include in my/your own<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    programs.

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s a quiz for you&hellip; What do deer, old cars, a saw mill, and black bears all have in common?  These are all things I regularly see on my rides around polk county.  The countryside by our cabin is some of the best riding around, every road is paved and very lightly travelled.  I can ride around any number of lakes and have all kinds of flexibility to make a route that is anywhere from 12 to 50 miles long.  Bone Lake, Half Moon, Pipe, Balsam, Little Blake, Butternut, these are a few of the lakes that I loop in and through on a regular basis.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, the other night I took my camera for a ride and focused more on the picture taking that the riding.

This little pond is at the bottom of a little hill and around a nice little corner.

I don&rsquo;t know which of us was more surprised!  The bear took off one way and I took off as fast as I could up the hill and past the pond.  We&rsquo;ve never seen each other again.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Well, today is our last official day of vacation.  Tomorrow is a day of travel back to Dublin and then we wake up and head to the airport to see Kaia off to France and the rest of us to Chicago.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After our rain soaked day yesterday we were thrilled to wake up to see the sun and big puffy white clouds today. What a difference the sun makes!  Our departure this morning was slightly delayed as we were still drying shoes and clothing from yesterday, and (I suspect) because most of the group was in Roundstone partying at the pub until late last night.  The Miller family stayed and had dinner at the castle last night as we are all showing the wear of nearly four weeks on the road.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can&rsquo;t imagine what the maid must have though when she came into our room this morning.  I had been sitting on the floor drying 3 pairs of shoes with the blow drier; the shoes I&rsquo;ve worn every day for the last 3 weeks, Josh&rsquo;s tennis shoes, and Jane&rsquo;s walking shoes.  The smell was indescribable.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When we did take off we headed out toward Roundstone, a beautiful little seaside village which is becoming very popular among the well to do here in Ireland.  When you come into town you go right past the house of the guy who wrote the original River Dance. From Roundstone we made our way along the coast toward Ballyconeely where we had our first &lsquo;table stop&rsquo; of the day. Padraic was busy setting out a table with fruit and granola bars and juice for us.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We only had a little further to go to get to Clifden, so we decided to do the Sky Drive loop before lunch rather than after.  That turned out to be a great decision as the weather cooperated perfectly and we were treated to magnificent views of the sea.  Based on the color of the sea you would think that you were in the Caribbean not Ireland!  As you might guess the Sky drive was a bit of a climb but it takes you right out to a point where you can see ocean in three different directions. Here&rsquo;s the Miller family at our stop on the point.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course by this time our guides had already schemed to set up another table stop.  They had gone to the store in Clifden and bought some more Bulmers cider, this was the new berry flavor that Padraic had not had before so he was even more excited than usual for us to give it a try.  We toasted a great trip and all of our new found friends.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The ride back into Clifden was mostly downhill, but by this time we really were ready for some food.  We ate at E.J. Kings pub, Jane and I had the chicken curry, Kaia had ravioli, and Josh had a club sandwich.  I think Padraic was a little disappointed that we had strayed from traditional irish fare but by this time our palate&rsquo;s were ready for something a little more spicy.  We all had to laugh at Josh during lunch because we were talking about the weather and how lucky we were that it wasn&rsquo;t raining like it was yesterday.  I said yes, it only rains in Ireland on days that contain a &lsquo;y.&rsquo;  Jane and Kaia laughed and the conversation moved on.  Suddenly, from out of the blue, Josh says, &ldquo;wait every day has a &lsquo;y&rsquo; in it.&rdquo;  We still love him.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the time we finished lunch it was almost 3:00 and it was time to head back to the Castle.  The Miller family took off a little ahead of the pack, and then Josh and I separated from Jane and Kaia, we made it back in record time.  It was our flattest ride yet.  The interesting thing about riding through the bog is how similar it looks to the prairies of Southern Minnesota, except where the glaciers flattened all the granite in Minnesota there were no glaciers here so the granite still stands in small hills and big chunks of rock sticking up out of the landscape.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Josh and I were so fast  that I missed the last table stop.  A little bit of Jameson Irish Whiskey to toast our final ride.  Not being a whiskey fan, that did not hurt my feelings except that Padraic insisted on pouring me a glass in the parking lot of the Castle when he caught up to us.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tonight we have our final group meal in the main dining room here at the castle.  Based on the look I had at the menu last night it will be a feast.  This has really been a great way to finish up our vacation.  The people in our group have been a lot of fun, and DuVine really lives up to their motto, Bike, Eat, Drink, Sleep.  In the photo above we have in the front row, Dan, Craig, Kaia, Laurie, and Joanna.  In the back row we have Patty (Dan&rsquo;s wife) Bobby and Brian, Brad and Jane, Josh, and James (Joanna&rsquo;s fiance)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Not in the picture are our two amazing guides for the week Padraic and Kirk.  These guys are amazing and made for a really fun week.

			 <p>We are staying in a castle!  Ashford castle to be precise.  It&rsquo;s about an hour outside of Galway and it&rsquo;s absolutely beautiful.  We arrived yesterday afternoon with our DuVine Adventures guides Kirk and Padraic.  Yesterday was mostly about checking to the room, getting our bikes fit, and getting to know our fellow cyclists.  There are a total of 12 of us on the trip and everyone is really nice.  There are no other young adults on the trip but so far everyone has been very welcoming of Josh and Kaia.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This morning we woke up to what the irish call a soft rain, we might call it a mist but I like the irish term better.  It really is so soft that you forget about the precipitation until you are totally soaked by it.  We had a nice breakfast here at the castle and then Josh and I went golfing at the nine hole course, and Jane went along with some of our fellow cyclists to a falconry class.  It was amazing, they got to wear the leather glove, and the falcon would take off and land from their arm.  Meanwhile Josh and I were sharing a set of clubs and getting soaked while playing some golf in Ireland.  The course was not too hard, and on the par three I almost got a legitimate hole in one, see my previous post on St. Andrews!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At noon we took off on our first true ride of the tour.  We cycled up the road a bit to stop for lunch in a small pub.  The only problem was that the soft rain had not abated, and according to our head waiter at the castle, &ldquo;If its still raining at 11, its probably going to keep raining all day.&rdquo;  It really was a soft rain and although we were all quite wet at our lunch stop we dried out rather quickly as well.  Our destination for the afternoon was Joyce Country Sheepdogs.  Here we Met Joe Joyce who is a sheep farmer and breeder of working dogs.  If you have seen Marley and Me, you have seen Joe&rsquo;s sheep and one of his dogs (not Marley &ndash; Its the scene where the sheep are blocking the road)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Joe showed us how the dogs herd the sheep and how they respond to his verbal or whistled commands.  He lives in a beautiful stone house, and his sheep roam the mountains across the lake from his home.  When he needs to bring the sheep in for something, which happens five times a year, he brings his dogs across the lake and he commands them using his whistle from a boat where he has a better view.  These dogs are amazing, they WANT to work so hard for him they go crazy when its not their turn to herd the sheep.  I should say it rained on us the last couple of miles to Joe&rsquo;s house so we were all like drowned rats when we got their.  Thankfully while we were there the rain let up and the sun started to break through.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The ride back was even more beautiful than the ride out, thanks in large part to the lack of rain.  Its amazing how green and beautiful the Irish countryside is.  The mountains go directly down to the lake shore and the lakes themselves are incredibly beautiful.  Tonight we had our second amazing dinner at the castle, this dinner was much less formal than last night&rsquo;s sport coat and tie affair, but my seafood chowder was to die for, the fish and chips were good, and then the desert, a white chocolate rhubarb tart was amazing.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tomorrow we have about 40 miles to bike to our next destination and another delicious dinner, I&rsquo;m already looking forward to it, and I hope we will have sun all day tomorrow.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>The other night on our pub crawl, Eugene told us a story about the Irish people and how they would conquer the world.  He started with the excuse that Ireland has been invaded by just about everyone else on the planet, and how Ireland has a hopeless military;  but went on to describe their master plan.  According to Eugene when you go into a bar in Ireland you are likely to be ignored for a while, but if you stick around eventually someone will come up and start talking to you.  This is not because they are especially friendly, but because the are especially nosey.  &ldquo;Within 15 minutes they will have your name, your parents names, your grandparents names, and your home address.&rdquo;  This information is useful he says because sometime in the future, when you least expect it &ldquo;this person will show up on your door with a sleeping bag in hand.&rdquo;  They&rsquo;ll find a quite place to settle down and sometime later fifteen of them will emerge!  And this is how Ireland will conquer the world.  We all laughed.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Last night at Fagan&rsquo;s pub we experienced part one of this scenario.  We were watching the USA versus Ghana match having a nice time, enjoying a pint and some appetizers, and being cheerfully ignored by all the locals. Suddenly I felt a hand on my shoulder and turned around awkwardly to find a red-haired man in a gold and green striped jersey wishing the USA good luck. He wanted to know if we were on holiday here in Ireland? If we were football fans? How long we were staying?  What we were doing in Galway? What was our surname?  Where were we from?  (city and state)  As this very friendly irishman took a break of his inquisition to get another pint, Josh leaned over to me and said &ldquo;Dad he&rsquo;s going to show up on our door with his sleeping bag!&rdquo;  I just about fell on the floor laughing!  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Partway through the second half the whole scenario repeated itself with two different guys.  It was all great fun, especially when Donovan tied up the score on his PK and the whole pub was cheering.  Sadly that all came to an end early on in the overtime period when our world cup hopes for USA were dashed.  Now we are left to wonder who to cheer for and whether our enthusiasm for watching world cup will wane after this defeat.  We have watched a lot of football on this trip, its been a fun constant for us in a sea of daily change.  Its forced us to sit down and relax at 4:00 or 8:30 most days rather than continuing to tour and walk.  Its revived my taste for a good pint of beer.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Galway, Ireland<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>This morning we are on the train from Dublin to Galway.  We woke up to a bright blue sky in Dublin, packed up our belongings, and left our little apartment for the tram to the train station.  Although the apartment itself was a bit sketchy it was in a great neighborhood and we had wonderful restaurants up and down the block.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Last night we had a wonderful Thai meal at Koh.  We shared three appetizers and three main course dishes.  For the appetizers we had mixed satays, vietnamese beef balls, and ceviche.  All were delicious.  For the main course we shared green curry with chicken, cashew chicken, and panang curry with beef.  I think we each had our own favorite it was all so good.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yesterday was definitely a full day of touristing in Dublin.  We started off our day on the hop-on-hop-off tour bus.  Our first hop-off was at the Guinness storehouse.  This is a building that Guinness has turned into a monument to all things Guinness.  The building is designed so that your tour takes you around and around and on a spiral upward around the worlds largest Guinness pint glass.  We learned about how Guinness is brewed, about the history of Guinness, and how to pour the perfect pint of Guinness.  At the Gravity bar at the very top of the pint glass we were in an all glass circular room with great views of Dublin, there we could trade our ticket for&hellip;.. A pint of Guinness!  Here&rsquo;s Josh and I in front of the waterfall&hellip;good pure water is key to making Guinness.  Mr Guiness signed a 9000 year lease for the land on which the brewery sits in part because of it&rsquo;s access to the pure water flowing in from the Dublin Mountains.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After the Guinness tour we hopped back on the bus and headed for the Gaol. By this time we were very hungry and so we decided to find a bit of lunch.  There was not much to choose from in the area around the Gaol but Dolce Vita caught our attention almost right away.  We had some very nice pizzas and Kaia had a steaming hot bowl of Spaghetti Carbonara.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Kilmainham Gaol is a famous site in Dublin as it is the place where 14 of the 16 leaders of the Easter rebellion were executed.  It is a very old gaol and the history goes back well before the time of the potato famine in Ireland.  It was during the famine that the overcrowding at the gaol was at its worst.  The gaol has been featured in several movies including Michael Connelly, and the original version of The Italian Job.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the time we had finished our guided tour of the gaol our feet were tired so we hopped back on the bus and rode it all the way around to where we had started.  Along the way we saw lots of other sites of Dublin.  The hop-on-hop-off busses are all double decker busses with open tops so we sat up top and enjoyed the scenery.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We returned to our apartment for a little break and decided to head out to find a pub with internet access.  We chose the Church bar, which is a bar/restaurant that has emerged from the remodeled Saint Mary&rsquo;s church in Dublin.  This is the first bar I&rsquo;ve been in that has its own pipe organ!  The pipe organ, built in the 18th century was used by G. F. Handel.  In addition there are several famous people who are buried in the church/pub, and there have been some important weddings including Alfred Guinness.  How appropriate to have a pint of Guinness in the place where he was married.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After happy hour and then dinner at Koh we were all ready to just kick back and watch the world cup match in our apartment while we finished up washing all of our clothes.  The match between Chile and Spain was a yawner, as chile seemed to be willing to place their hopes on Switzerland playing to a draw.  Its been very interesting traveling to all of the different companies during the world cup competition.  We have seen lots of different kinds of coverage and commentators.  Last night on Irish TV there were four  very old guys who spent forever dissecting the match and making the case that Spain was really going to have to pick up their game if they had any hope of progressing during the elimination round.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Today is a pretty light day.  We&rsquo;ll get in to Galway just after noon, and we don&rsquo;t have much planned other than some light walking around and scoping out somewhere to watch USA play tonight.  Josh and I are both wearing our USA jerseys today.  Good Luck team USA.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the train from Dublin to Galway<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Well last night a bit of Dublin had a taste of some Jim Croce music.  I&rsquo;m not sure where it came from but we were enjoying the musical pub crawl that started in Tower Square.  Our two guides for the night were Eugene, who played the Irish banjo, and Steve who was a guitar player.  After a couple of pubs and a lot of good Irish Jigs and Reels, and some history of Irish music and instruments were were walking between pubs and I started up a conversation with Steve.  Steve also plays a Taylor guitar and it is the same model I have at home.  That was the kiss of death.  &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asks Eugene.  Brad, I say.  &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve got you&rdquo; says Eugene, at this next stop you&rsquo;ll have to play a little for us.  Uh, I don&rsquo;t think thats a very good idea I said.  We talk a little more about what kind of music I like to play and where we are visiting in Ireland and where we have already been.  Steve mentions that he is a fan of Prairie Home Companion and how some of the things that Keillor talks about on the show remind him of Ireland and I&rsquo;m thinking I&rsquo;m safe and the whole sing for us thing was simply a fun idle threat.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After we get to the next pub and the duo works through a couple more songs Eugene starts in on a long story about how its an Irish tradition to join in on a session and it doesn&rsquo;t matter how good you are or if you even just sing one verse or whatever, its all in good fun.  The next thing I know Steve is handing me the Taylor and a pick I&rsquo;m I&rsquo;m thinking what the heck am I going to play!?  Roller Derby Queen is Jane&rsquo;s suggestion and I think I can probably remember the chords and the words, so I start to strum a little bit to see if I can recall the right chords and pretty soon I&rsquo;m singing.  I make it through a couple of versus without too many mistakes and finish up to the applause of the rest of the pub crawlers. Thankfully they all had had a few pints of Guinness by now so they were not an overly discriminating audience.  Anyway, it was great fun.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So now that its the next morning and I&rsquo;m thinking about it, I realize that I really have quite an international performance background.  I&rsquo;ve played in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa.  I&rsquo;ve played with a group of Tahitians sitting in a plastic lawn chair in the South Seas. And now I&rsquo;ve played on an Irish pub crawl in Dublin.  It makes me wonder where I could go if I practiced some more!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After the pub crawl was over, we found a little Italian place that was still serving pasta at 10:30 at night and finished off our first day in Dublin.  The day had started out very early, in Stockholm with a train ride to the Arlanda airport.  We flew SAS from Stockholm to Dublin and then took a bus from the airport to the city center of Dublin.  Here in Dublin we are staying in one of the StayDublin.com apartments.   Its a bit sketchy and in need of paint and a good cleaning but the apartment has two bedrooms a living room a kitchen with one of those funky european washer/dryer units.  If anyone can tell me out to operate one of those things properly please send me an email.  We cannot get the dryer to work for anything. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After unloading our stuff at the apartment we started to explore the area a little.  We found a restaurant called Boojum, right by our apartment that is operated by a man from Philadelphia.  If you are looking for your fix of Chipotle right here in the heart of Dublin then Boojum is for you.  It was a nice lunch, and I think Josh was really happy with the food.  We took a tour of Trinity College and saw the Book of Kells.  This is an amazingly old illuminated version of the four gospels that has been preserved by the Trinity library, its a really interesting exhibit, and we had a great guide who is a student at Trinity and works for Ark.com, Ark sells clothing and the idea is that every time you wear an article of Ark clothing you perform An Act of Random Kindness.  Thats where the Ark name comes from.  The library at Trinity was also extremely interesting to me for two reasons.  First it is the largest single room library in Europe.  Its just beautiful to see books and bookshelves stretched out for a city block.  But the second reason is interesting to my twisted computer science mind because of how the books are organized in the library.  The books are sorted by SIZE!  In order to find a book in this library you must know the exact dimensions of the book to get you to the proper shelf!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After the tour of Trinity we just walked around and enjoyed the street performers and the shops of Dublin.  Josh wanted to go to the Leprechaun museum but he was out voted 3 to 1.  So we went back to the apartment to rest our feet and find an internet cafe to catch up on email and Facebook before the pub crawl.  Today we are doing a hop-on-hop-off tour of the city and plan to take the tour of the Guiness Brewery and the Dublin Gaol.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Dublin, Ireland<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Today we heard the name Gustavus Adophus quite a lot.  With apologies to my friends in St. Peter I must say he didn&rsquo;t know much about ship building.  In all truth it really wasn&rsquo;t his fault from a technical point of view, but he did pay the bill.  I am talking about the Vasa of course.  It is the largest ship to be recovered and salvaged and conserved in a museum.  This is definitely a must see sight if you go to Stockholm.  The Vasa was built in 1628 and was the largest ship in the Swedish fleet.  Unfortunately she sunk on her maiden voyage out of the harbor!  The reason she sank was because there was not enough ballast in the ship to counterbalance the forces on the sails in the heavy breeze.  This seems like an incredibly dumb mistake for a ship builder to make, but there you have it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The ship lay submerged for 333 years until an amazing recovery operation in the 1960&rsquo;s brought the ship to the surface.  The Vasa is amazingly well preserved due to the water conditions in the Baltic.   The museum is just as interesting for the story of how the ship was raised to the surface and preserved as it was to learn about the building of the ship in 1628.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Vasa Museum was our first stop today in Stockholm.  Our day started early as we had to debark from the vision of the seas by 7:40.  The sailing in to Stockholm was once again beautiful and very reminiscent of Wisconsin and Northern Minnesota.  We are all very lonely for our cabin at the sight of water, boats, rave trampolines and all the pine trees.  The rest of the morning we wandered around stockholm enjoying the shops and the old town.  We did a little shopping.  I got an official USA soccer jersey to wear for the game today.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After walking around all morning we returned to our hotel to check in and rest up a bit.  We are staying in the Rica Hotel on Gamla Stan in a wonderful part of stockholm.  The streets around here are narrow and cobbled and there are restaurants and bars and little shops everywhere.  We hunted around a little bit to decide where to have a late afternoon dinner and watch the USA versus Algeria match.  We found O&rsquo;Leary&rsquo;s, a boston themed restaurant owned by a swede who spent time in Boston.  They had the England match on upstairs and the USA match on down.  The American fans were many and much louder than the brits.  In a funny small world moment I recognized one of the other fans in the restaurant as the same person we had watched football with when we were in Balestrand!  They were originally from Minnesota but had moved to Boston.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To catch up on our activities, yesterday we were in Tallin Estonia, and the day before was a day at sea.  Tallin was a really nice city, it has the oldest medieval walled city in Europe.  The city reminded us a little of Italy and of some of the walled cities we had visited in Tuscany.  The city is an interesting mix of scandinavian and Russian influences.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jane had a walking tour of the city that we got on the internet and we followed that plan around the city for several hours.  After that we returned to the ship for our last night on board.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We are having a great time, but we are all very tired today.  We just didn&rsquo;t have a lot of energy for many touring activities.  And the USA victory took a lot of energy as well.  Early to bed tonight, but up again early tomorrow morning for our flight to Dublin.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Stockholm, Sweden<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>After days and days of using our feet to get around european cities it was time for a change, and what better city to try two wheeled touring in than Copenhagen.  Copenhagen has more bikes than anywhere else in the world.  They make the people of Portland look like a bunch of slackers.  There are literally bikes everywhere.  At the train stations there are bike racks two stories high, there are bike racks everywhere and people riding their bikes everywhere.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jane found Biking with Mike on the internet, he is a lifelong resident of Copenhagen who left his job as a director at a large company to do what he loves &ndash; bike and tell people about his city.  There is no fancy signup procedure as each days tours are first come first served.  If the weather is horrible there won&rsquo;t be a tour.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We left the ship at 9:30 and headed straight for Mike&rsquo;s bike shop.  We knew the tour was not until 10:30 but we wanted to make sure we got a spot on the tour.  We arrived by taxi 5 minutes later, but the shop did not even open until 10:00.  So we walked around the area a little bit and decided to get a coffee at the cafe up the block from Mike&rsquo;s.  One minor problem was that we hadn&rsquo;t taken the time to find a cash machine and get some Danish Kroners.  After preparing our coffee we discovered that the credit card reader in the coffee shop was not working properly, and so we were unable to pay.  In Decorah, this would not really be a problem, go find some money and pay me later.  Who would have guessed that we would find the same attitude in a big city?  This appears to be the Danish way.  The proprietor of the coffee shop was perfectly happy to have us go on our bike tour, get some cash, and pay him later in the day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shortly after 10 Mike arrived.  Bright green stocking hat, bright green shoes, a yellow and black livestrong vest and fashionable glasses.  His bike matched his cycling outfit.  Mike took us on a tour for a little over 3 hours.  We saw the palace, the castle, the parliament buildings, the house where Hans Christian Anderson was born, the new opera house, a couple of parks, and a little lawless place called Christiana.  We would bike for a while and then stop and mike would give us a short lecture on what were were looking at, Danish politics, Danish culture, local gossip, you name it and MIke knew about it.  He is an excellent story teller.  As we were riding there was no talking, the idea is to absorb the local feeling of the place as you are riding rather than chatting.  It worked.  It was fun, we saw a lot of the city.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Christiana was the most interesting stop on the tour.  We had coffee in the moonshine cafe.  It is the safest coffee house in Copenhagen. Why?  The sign on the door tells the story.  More than 6000 police inspections since 2004.  Christiana is the counter culture area of Copenhagen, Mike discouraged us from taking any pictures in the area because you never know when you might accidentally capture a deal going down, and they don&rsquo;t like that.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We learned one word of Danish that really sums up our Copenhagen experience.  The word is Hygglite, it is difficult to describe exactly what it means, cozy is one possible translation while fantastic is another.  Internet people might translate it as &ldquo;A Good Thing.&rdquo;  Its a word they use in Denmark to describe when something is just right and good.  Our bike tour of Copenhagen with mike was definitely Hygglite.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the conclusion of our tour we paid mike and headed, on foot, back through the park on the way to the ship.  When we emerged from the park, there was Mike on his bike.  Hello he said, I wonder if you might have a few minute to talk to a reporter from the paper Politik?  Its the largest Danish paper and they are doing a story about touring copenhagen on bike.  It seems that the reporter for the paper was planning to go on Mike&rsquo;s afternoon tour, but because of the oncoming rain Mike had cancelled the afternoon tour.  So, we agreed to spend a few minutes talking to the reporter and then we got our picture taken by one of the photographers from the paper.  So, if you speak Danish you can read about the Miller family and our bike fun in the city of Copenhagen!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Copenhagen, Denmark<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>This morning we got to sleep in, have a relaxing breakfast, catch up on some email and reading, and then we started our long day&rsquo;s journey.  As I&rsquo;m writing this its 10:45 and we are still an hour out of Oslo.  Of course it is also still full daylight outside, and we are hopeful that it will still be light for our short walk to the hotel when we arrive.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first leg of our trip today started with the same Sognefjorden ferry that we arrived in Balestrand on yesterday.  Only this time we rode it for only 45 minutes.  When made a mid-fjord transfer to another ferry, this one was actually a passenger and car ferry, which took us down the &ldquo;Narrow Fjord&rdquo;  This is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is the narrowest fjord with boat traffic on it.  It is spectacular!  We stopped counting waterfalls because there were simply too many.  The steepness of the cliffs coming down to the water was just beautiful.  We passed three tiny villages that have no roads leading to them, the only way in or out is by boat.  The natural scenic beauty of this part of the world really is stunning.  Along the way in the fjord I had a quick glimpse of two porpoises as well!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Our final destination for this ferry was  Gudvangen, this is a tiny little town on the other side of two very long tunnels from Fløm.  There is not much here except for some souvenir shops, a small restaurant, and the ferry landing.  We had about an hour and half to wait for our bus to Fløm.  The bus stop was literally a wide spot in the highway from Bergen, but our bus was right on time to take us to Fløm.  Right outside of town was the first tunnel, it was 11.4 kilometers long.  We had a short break and then another 5 kilometer tunnel.  After this tunnel we were in Fløm, and the railway station.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The final legs of the journey are by train, we started off on the Fløm railway. Which goes up into the mountains 20km, at about a 55 degree slope!  It is the steepest non-cogwheel railway anywhere.  Again the scenery and waterfalls were marvelous.  We spent the entire trip looking out the windows of the train and snapping pictures as fast as we could.  We were not quite sure about this train trip when we first boarded as a hoard of toga clad norwegians got onto the same train car as us.  They were quite loud and all carrying a can of the local brew.  They were on the train for less than 1 km before they all got off the train, in the middle of nowhere.  For all we know they are still wandering around the hills near Fløm celebrating some strange holiday we don&rsquo;t know about.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The final stop of the Fløm railway is at Myrdral which basically consists of a train station up in the mountains.  When we got off the train it was actually snowing!  We had a short wait for the Bergen to Oslo train to come along and we jumped on.  We have been riding in Coach 2, which looks to be the student car on the train.  It seems that many students from Bergen must be returned home to Oslo for the summer.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tonight we will check into the Thon hotel in Oslo, and I suspect we will all sleep in again tomorrow morning.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Norway<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>After the late night heavy metal concert in Bergen, we were all very ready for some peace and quiet.  We found it in Balestrand Norway.  To get to Balestrand we took the early morning Ferry out of Bergen, and came up through the Fjords to get here.  The Beauty of the Fjords is beyond describing in words, so here are a few pictures.  First, leaving Bergen on the Ferry:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->From Bergen, we travelled North, between the coast, and all the little islands that protect the coast from the North sea.  After about two hours we turned inland into Sognefjord, The longest and deepest fjord in Norway.  From here on, it was just one beautiful sight after another.  Here&rsquo;s a typical picture from the back of the ferry:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->All along the fjords you see these nice houses either up on the hillside, or tucked down near the water.  Sometimes there is a boathouse right over the water as in the picture above.  Notice how still the water is, and the contrast of the green of the trees on the shore with this stunning blue water is just great.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When we arrived in Balestrand we were met by our host, one member of the family that owns and runs the Balestrand Hotel, which is in my mind the nicest and friendliest place we have stayed yet.  The rooms have an amazing view out over the fjord, as you can see from this shot out off the deck of our hotel room.  If you go to Balestrand, you should definitely stay here, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to upgrade to the fjord view, it is worth it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The rooms here, have no TV in them, but who needs a TV when you have a view like this?  We did go downstairs to the lobby area where they have a breakfast room, a reading room, with computer, and a TV area.  We enjoyed watching some football with a very international crowd.  Its interesting hearing the perspectives of the other people on the games, and of course its different to watch the football match when the announcers are speaking in Norwegian.  The truth is its kind of a welcome relief from the English announcers.  All they do is talk about England this and England that&hellip;  I suppose the American announcers are the same way, and they probably talk way too much.  The truth is you don&rsquo;t need an announcer telling you much when you watch football.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Balestrand is not a very large town, we were able to walk everywhere from our hotel, and see just about everything.  There is a small aquarium that shows you some of the sea life living in the fjords, a couple of small lunch places and one other hotel called the Kviknes.  Hotel Kviknes is the largest wooden structure in Scandanavia.  We ended up having supper there last night and it was quite good.  I had a wonderful veal, Jane had risotto, Kaia pasta, and josh had a triple decker club sandwich.  While were were seated we struck up a conversation with an older british couple and had a very nice chat.  It is interesting to hear the English perspective on what is going on with the BP oil spill in the gulf of mexico.  It is clear that although the british people have been supportive of Obama in the past many are taking his anger at BP somewhat personally.  Of course football is alway another good topic to take up with the Brits, luckily this couple were very sportsmanlike about our competition.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This morning we were able to sleep in and have a nice breakfast in the hotel.  At noon we board the ferry again, and head for Oslo.  Today is a travel Odyssey, we&rsquo;ll be on two ferries, a bus, and two trains to take us to Oslo.  We won&rsquo;t get in until after 11:00 tonight, but of course it will still be broad daylight so we aren&rsquo;t particularly worried.  I&rsquo;ll leave you with one more image of the fjords and beautiful Balestrand.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Balestrand, Norway<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Last night after we ate our dinner at the Ship Inn we came out to this sight.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The tide had gone out and left all of the boats stranded on the sand.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This morning we flew from Aberdeen Scotland to Bergen Norway, the landing was absolutely spectacular.  I&rsquo;ve never seen so many small islands in my life.  Plus, the sky was perfectly blue for the first time in many days, and so the whole scene was amazing.  Getting through customs and the rest of the airport went just as smoothly as you would expect from a scandinavian country.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We immediately found our SAS Airbus to take us downtown to our hotel.  We are at the Hotel Thon, it is on the end of Byrggen Street, right across the road from the harbor.  Its a very nice location, except that it is next to a huge city park.  What is wrong with that you may ask.  Well, it turns out that we picked the wrong night to stay at the Thon hotel next to the park, as tonight is the night of the Rammstein concert.  Who are Rammstein you may ask? After a little internet searching I quickly learned that Rammstein are a German industrial metal band.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We are actually on the opposite side of the hotel from the concert but at the moment it is making no difference.  We are trying to watch the world cup, but the sound from the concert is so loud it is drowning out the Brazilian national anthem.  I would much prefer the sounds of those dumb world cup horns to the sound of a german industrial metal band.  We can only hope that the concert will wrap up at a respectable time.  Josh just found a view of the concert and said it looks like a bunch of black ants (yes all the concert goers are dressed in black T-shirts) streaming toward a rotting apple.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->OK, enough grousing, Bergen really is a nice city.  We started our tour of Bergen by meeting one of Kaia&rsquo;s facebook friends named Thomas at our hotel.  Thomas had visited Decorah with a group of Norwegian students a couple of years ago, and volunteered to get us oriented to the city when he saw Kaia&rsquo;s Facebook status.  He showed us around the area including the wharf and the fish market and the central park of Bergen.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jane and Kaia spent some time shopping around the city for a sweater for Kaia.  They were successful, and so Kaia can proudly celebrate her heritage at concord, and at Christmas time.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We took the Funicular up high above the city this afternoon and the view is amazing.  We took Thomas' recommendation for a restaurant for supper tonight and went to Egon&rsquo;s.  It is a Norwegian chain restaurant and the food was OK.  I think we have officially reached the point of vacation where choosing a place to eat for supper and dinner in a new strange city has become somewhat of a chore.  We miss the home cooking.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tomorrow morning we have another fairly early morning, as we must be on board our ferry boat at 8 AM for the trip to Balestrand, of course early morning takes on a whole new connotation at this time of the year at this latitude.   We are now far enough north that there is only a couple hours of darkness at this time of the year.  Darkness is only from midnight until a little after 2 AM.  The Ferry trip tomorrow promises to be a beautiful trip through the fjords, we are all looking forward to it very much.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For now we are resting and watching Brazil and the People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea play some football.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bergen, Norway<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Can you possibly imagine a better way to top off a trip to St. Andrews than with a hole in one?  Well thats what I did!!  Josh and I were playing this morning, and it was on the 16th hole.  I hit my drive perfectly straight, just a little left of the pin, right where I had aimed it.  It rolled, broke to the right and dropped straight into the cup.   Here&rsquo;s where the story gets really weird, two holes later, Josh also got a hole in one.  Thats right, on number 18 at St. Andrews.  He hit his drive past the hole, up the hill, and it rolled straight back down into the cup.  A truly amazing shot.  You may be wondering which course we were on.  Well unfortunately it was not the old course.  It was a course called the Himalayas and it is the official putting green of the old course.  They have 18 holes laid out, and you can rent a putter and balls.  No, silly clowns mouths or windmills allowed, this is just a very challenging, and highly rolling putting green.  In fact we had to wait until 11:00 this morning to tee off because they have a ladies putting league that plays before that.  It is complete with its own clubhouse and everything.  Here I am in my fashionable St. Andrews argyle sweater, getting ready to tee it up!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We arrived in St. Andrews yesterday afternoon, after visiting Castle Edinburgh in the morning.  The castle was very interesting, and we again learned some interesting Scottish history.  We stayed in the hotel Rusacks' which looks right out over the 18th Fairway on the old course.  We could sit in our room and look out at both number 1 and 18 fairways.  They have already done a lot of work getting ready for the Open.  This is the last week that the public can play on the course until afterwards.  So there are lots of grandstands under construction.   The great thing is that the course is closed on sunday so the public can walk the course.  So we did.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We&rsquo;ve talked a lot these last few days about walking where other famous people have walked.  We&rsquo;ve walked the same rooms and stairways as Mary Queen of Scots, King Henry the VIII, Oliver Cromwell, and many others.  Now we can add to our list Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklas, Old Tom Murray, and even Tiger.  The room that we stayed in at Rusacks is the same room used by Arnold Palmer, and other golfers.  In addition Mick Jagger also stayed in our room.  I don&rsquo;t know that Mick cares about golf but he was on the list.  I&rsquo;m sure they will be adding the Miller family to the list any day now.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back to walking the course, it was really fun to walk along and remember seeing some of our golfing hero&rsquo;s and where they hit great shots and where they got in trouble.  We found lots of deep bunkers to take our picture in too.  Here is one of me on the Swilcan Bridge:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This blog entry would not be complete without a little culinary update.  Last night we ate at Nahm-Jim  a Thai restaurant right in the heart of St. Andrews.  We had some delicious curry, and Josh claims he had the best Pad-Thai of his life there.  Very good stuff.  After dinner the tide had gone way out, so Josh and I hiked out on the beach, we got a great look back at St. Andrews.  You can see the Golf museum lit up on the far right, and some of the temporary construction they have stared for the open, also on the far right.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After a very light lunch in St. Andrews today, we finally gave in to Josh&rsquo;s urge to have a Subway Sandwich, we drove to Stonehaven.  Stonehaven is a small town outside Aberdeen,  its probably about the same size as Decorah, but its right on the North Sea.  Our Bed and Breakfast overlooks the town harbor and is really beautiful.  We took an Awesome hike out to Donnotter castle.  This castle is all in ruins but it is such a great setting, its was really amazing.  This is the site where they filmed Mel Gibson&rsquo;s version of Hamlet.   This picture gives you a sense for how isolated the castle is.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->St. Andrews, Scotland<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>One week after watching our Decorah Vikings take third in the state soccer tournament we were back watching futbol again.  This time we were in Edinburgh Scotland watching USA play England.  Now before you get too worried about us cheering for our side on the home turf of our opponent let me just clarify that when England is playing the Scottish will cheer very loudly for the other team!  As soon as we arrived in Edinburgh Josh. Changed into his USA jersey, and as we were waking around Edinburgh he got lots of comments from the locals.  &ldquo;nice top there son&rdquo;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So it came to pass that we found ourselves in a hotel bar with lots of support for USA.  On one side was a group of about 20 younger scottish men, and on the other were some additional tourists like ourselves.  We had hoped to experience the game in a pub, but unfortunately they do not allow minors after 8pm.  It was great fun to watch the game here, but I must say that I have grown used to the expert commentary of my friend Jim, who is leading a group of Luther alumni on a trip through Germany at the moment.  I am sure Jim found a good place to watch the game there with some German support.  You see all kinds of people when you watch the game in a hotel bar.  At one point an Asian man came in, and stared at the screen for a couple of minutes before asking &ldquo;what half is it?&rdquo;. One of our scottish compatriots replied, well I don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re from mate but when the clock says forty two minutes here you&rsquo;re in the first half.  It sounds even funnier when you hear it with the accent.  Needless to say that particular fan did not stick around to watch much of the game.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When the Americans scored (yes it was an error on the English keeper) the whole bar erupted in cheers and then a chant of USA USA started up.  The bar manager looked like he couldn&rsquo;t decide what to do.  He clearly wanted to  calm everyone down and was obviously worried that a riot was going to break out in his bar.   But he had no idea how what the right strategy was.  In the end order was restored by some humor.  After the cheers erupted and the chant had started one of the scottish fans came running back into the room to see what all of the commotion was about.  As he had been in the toilet, he made a great show of zipping up his zipper which put everyone to laughing, including the manager.  Although I was disappointed to settle for the draw, I think it is a good result for the American side. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Earlier in the day we did spend some time walking around Edinburgh, we walked the Royal Mile, and checked out Holyrood House.  We have now seen all the royal residences except for Balmoral.  The big story of Holyrood is that this is where Mary Queen of Scots spent a lot of time, and it is also where her young son was killed right before her eyes by her husband.  Nice guy, who wanted the throne bad enough to kill his stepson.

			 <p>I am writing this on the train from London to Edinburgh where they have just announced the breakfast options.  I don&rsquo;t get the concept of &ldquo;English breakfast.&rdquo;  I would like to meet the chef who came up with the idea of serving baked beans and eggs together!  My guess is that if I did meet him I would learn that he was also the inventor of the &ldquo;Pudding Menu.&rdquo;  At every hotel the included breakfast consists of eggs, bacon, and baked beans. I don&rsquo;t like baked beans under the best of conditions, and certainly not first thing in the morning.  I guess it must be one of those things you need to grow up with in order to appreciate.  In the meantime I will just stick to having tea.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Anyway, now that I have addressed the breakfast issue I will praise the train system.  This is really a the way to travel.  We have four seats facing each other in coach, tons of legroom, a table in between us, great scenery, free wifi, and a very quiet ride.  No long hassles of getting to the station 90 minutes ahead of time, and no long security lines.  Just walk to the platform, get on your train, stow your luggage and take a seat.  As we reevaluate travel the US I really wonder what it would take to get this kind of convenience.  I, for one would travel this way whenever possible.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also want to say how much I love traveling with my iPad!  This thing is great.  It&rsquo;s small, light, the battery life is awesome, I have a bunch of books to read on it, a couple of movies to watch, the current season of Merlin, and games to entertain me when I am tired of all of the above. Other than if I really needed to write a program I can not imagine why I would ever need to travel with a laptop.  In fact I think this is really the start of something new.  I don&rsquo;t see myself needing a laptop.  My setup would be a nice big desktop machine for programming and writing in LaTeX, and my iPad for the times I am not at my desk.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, as long as I&rsquo;m rambling on about products and travel I have to say that I love my ScotteVest. (<a href="http://www.scottevest.com">www.scottevest.com</a>).  Its a vest designed for travel, that includes zip pockets for just about everything.  I can carry camera lenses, glasses, iPod, phone, and all kinds of things.  I think it has 20 pockets in total, so there is a pocket for just about everything.  It keeps me warm at the temperatures we are traveling in at the moment, and with all the zippers and inner pockets I feel pretty secure.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Today&rsquo;s travel adventure involved the Tower of London.  No, we were not arrested and tortured by the English royalty.  We were on a tour of the tower of london.  We had just finished the guided tour with one of the Yoman Warders (cool title eh?) and we decided to go in and check out the Armoury. (yep I&rsquo;m converting to british spelling)  Just after we got in the door an alarm started to go off, and a woman steward came hurrying buy and told us that we had to evacuate the tower.  We were never able to to find out why we had to evacuate but Jane overheard a couple of them talking about a fire alarm.  The tower of London is also the site where Henry VIII beheaded several of his wives, including Anne Boleyn.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We started our day by taking the tube to St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral.  After walking around the sanctuary we resumed our european stair climbing tradition.  We first walked 257 stairs to the whispering gallery.  This is a cool balcony where you can face the wall and whisper.  The person standing directly opposite you across the circle, over 100 feet away, can hear you perfectly clearly.  I&rsquo;d like to explain the physics of this but I&rsquo;m told that my readership will decline if I include any equations.  I guess all three of you are safe and will remain loyal readers.  After the whispering gallery we continued another 266 stairs up to the gold gallery.  From here we had a very good, but slightly foggy view of all of London.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next we walked across the Millennium bridge and toured Shakespeare&rsquo;s Globe theater.  This is a slightly modernized version of the original, but still true to the spirit of performing plays in daylight where the actors and audience are face to face.  It would have been really fun to try to watch a show there, but Macbeth is being performed at the moment and it seemed a bit dark, and long given our schedule for the day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now we are chilling at our hotel, the Luna Simone, watching Mexico and South Africa play futbol.  South Africa just scored and are up one nil.  Very exciting for the South African side.  We have been researching whether or not we dare show the american colors during the game tomorrow.  Research has indicated that the scottish people will cheer for ANY opponent of England, so we feel pretty comfortable about watching the game in a pub in Ediburgh tomorrow.  Maybe some nice scottish people will buy us a pint if we win!   (darn, Mexico just scored)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Kaia is waiting patiently for her phone call from her Concordia advisor to do her registration!  Then we&rsquo;ll grab a quick dinner and head out to see Billy Elliot at the Victoria Palace Theater.  We had three shows that we wanted to see while we were in London and this one won out since we walked right by the box office last night.  We also wanted to see Stomp, and We Will Rock You. Yes, a Queen musical, featuring Bohemian Rhapsody and of course We Will Rock You.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->London, England<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Do you remember Sir John Gielgud  from the movie Arthur? Jeeves maybe? Imagine the most proper british gentleman you can, and you will have our guide for the tour of Blenheim Palace we had today.  This guy was much shorter than Sir Gielgud but he was a pretty good guide.  He told us about fine china and tapestries the architects of the Palace along with many of the priceless artifacts that have been collected by the Spencer Churchill family over the years.  As we finished each room of the palace our guide would say very politely, well if there are no questions I think that just covers it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After our tour with Jeeves, we decided to see the Untold Story of Blenheim.  This is part Disney animatronics and part history lesson.  All in all it did not work for us.  The animated dummies they had playing the parts of members of the royal households were all placed in front of &lsquo;mirrors&rsquo; which were really computer screens, so although we looked at the dummy&rsquo;s back we saw a real person&rsquo;s face projected on the screen as if it was a reflection.  These characters tried to tell us the back story behind how the Palace was constructed.  One can only take so much royal sex scandal before it gets old.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blenheim Palace is the home of the family of the Duke of Marlborough, although once a year they have to send a flag to BUCKingham, yes you must say that with a British accent with all of the emphasis on the BUCK and you will have it just about right.  The purpose of the flags is to avoid paying what must be an incredible amount of rent.  As long as the flag is delivered on time the family gets another year rent free.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Blenheim was actually our second castle of the day today.  We started the morning by visiting Sudeley castle in the Cotswolds.  This is one of the castles where Henry VIII and his wives hung out.  Much of the castle is in ruins now, but it really is interesting, especially after watching several episodes of The Tudors on HBO.  Other highlights of Sudeley were the Gardens and the Peacocks that were running around and in captivity in the Pheasantry.  Yes, how many of  you have been to a Pheasantry??<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lunch today was at Noel Arms in Chipping Camden.

It was a nice English pub and we had to try some of the local brews, also quite good.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We stayed in Woodstock at The Bear, It is a hotel in a building that was built in the late 1600&rsquo;s!  The rooms are everywhere with no two alike.  While Kaia went for a run I had a real english G&amp;T although I really did not appreciate the use of the slice of cucumber in place of the lime.  Dinner was at a small family run italian restaurant (Branca) across the street from the hotel.  I had a great bolognese, Jane had Arrabiata, and Josh and Kaia had Pizza.  All in all this was a great birthday!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Woodstock, England<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Yesterday we flew from Chicago to London.  We tried a day flight instead of an overnight flight and it worked very well.  We left Chicago at 9:05AM and arrived at Heathrow at 10:30PM.  The flight was very easy an non-eventful, it worked perfect for someone who cannot fall asleep on an airplane.  We got into Heathrow and did the customs thing and by the time we got to our hotel it was after midnight.  To our bodies it was still early evening but by 1:30 we all had lights out and were working on sleep.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We did sleep in until 8:45 this morning.  From there we took off for Bath by way of Stonehenge.  For those of you who don&rsquo;t know, Stonehenge is a big circle of rocks.  Merlin the magician moved them down from Ireland sometime in the distant past.  This was well before King Uther died, because he is apparently buried in Stonehenge.  Here&rsquo;s Kaia and Josh at Stonehenge.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At lunchtime we at at a local establishment called Jacqueline&rsquo;s Bistro.  Jane and Kaia had fresh baked baguettes with goat cheese, Josh had a ham and cheese omelet with salad and I had fish and chips.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->From there we moved on to our final destination for today, Bath.  When you arrive in downtown Bath you are &ldquo;in a twisty turny maze&rdquo;  Its hard to know where you are, and the gps was equally unenlightened at several points.  When we finally did find the parking lot where we were supposed to leave our car, it was closed for re-surfacing!  So we had to go back to find a different lot that we had passed along the way.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After parking the car it was a very short walk to our Bed &amp; Breakfast at Three Abbey Green. We have a beautiful two room suite, so we have to room to spread out tonight.  Josh and Kaia both have their own beds and Kaia gets a separate bedroom.  Breakfast is included as part of the deal in the morning.  Here&rsquo;s a nice view of the courtyard and our place for the night.  The entrance is to the left of the giant tree in this photo:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We went out to view the sites of Bath, its a great downtown area once you are on foot.  We visited the Roman Baths - from whence Bath got its name  - and looked at the Abbey.  Went shopping to replace the shorts that I left hanging on the back of the bathroom door at the Super 8 in Chicago.  On the recommendation of our hotelier we went to the Eye of India for some great Indian food for dinner.  We had Tikki Takka Tak, (I&rsquo;m not making that up) Garlic Chili Masala, and Chicken Khorma, along with rice and nan.  Here&rsquo;s Kaia and Jane at the Baths.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The highlight of the day was definitely the after dinner show, called Bazaar Bath.  Its a comedy/magic show that roams around downtown.  The host entertains by poking fun of the people on the tour and doing tricks.  As advertised, you do not learn anything about the history or culture of Bath, but it is a lot of laughs and I highly recommend this show if you come to Bath.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unfortunately our string of injuries continues  as Jane seems to have slipped a disc as we were walking around for the show tonight.  Hopefully ibuprofen and heat will have her back as good as new in the morning.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Location:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bath, England<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>After spending a ton of money in town, what could be better than a great meal on the ship.  One of the activities that Jane had researched before the cruise is called the Chef&rsquo;s table.  This is a really exclusive experience that they only do once a cruise for a very limited number of people.  In our case there were ten of us lucky passengers that called toget our name on the list as soon as we got on the ship.  Of the ten all of us were experienced multi-cruise passengers.  A couple of Florida cruises 3 times a year.  Another couple from Ohio had cruised many times with their family.  They were a bit older than us as their kids were out of college by now.  The two other couples were both gay men.  Ha, no stereotypes here that a foodie event should have four gay men in attendance!  One couple was from LA and the other from New York. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We all met at the International cafe for a short pre-dinner briefing.  We met the Executive Chef who was our tour guide for the galley and the rest of the evening.  The chef directs a staff of around 250 spread throughout seven galleys on the ship.  We began our tour of the galley that served our dining room by putting on our white FDA inspector lab coats.  As the tour was happening during dinner service we had to wash our hands wear the lab coats. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The chef was really friendly and very willing to answer any of our questions.  We told him how much we liked the parmesan crust under the fettucine alfredo and he launched into a very detailed explanation of how they made the crusts each day.  I got the whole thing on video with our little video toy.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->At the end of the galley tour we gathered in an out of the way corner and had hors-de-ouveres and champagne.  We started out with a sashimi tuna with wasabi sauce, served on a little scoop made of a fennel root.  This was followed by:  a delicious pate, vegetarian quiche, Escargot, and caviar served on a little potato pancake.  Yes I ate everything including the caviar which was really very good served on the potato pancake with a little sour cream.  As he introduced each appetizer we got a summary of how it was prepared.  It was really interesting.  None of the appetizers or anything in our meal is available anywhere else on the ship.  It is a meal that is totally unique to the Chefs Table dinner.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After the appetizers we made our way through the dining room to a special table.  As we walked through the dining room everyone applauded the chef and many applauded us as well having no idea that we were just on a special tour!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->While we were in the kitchen we were promised a lobster risotto and some &ldquo;special surprises&rdquo;  We began with another little appetizer and some Pouilly Fume.  The latest appetizer was beef carpacio on foccacia.  The carpacio was layered with alternating layers of parmesan cheese and arugula.  It was good but too much considering everything else we knew was coming.   Next was the Lobster Risotto.  This was probably the best Risotto I&rsquo;ve ever had in a restaurant.  (except maybe that one exceptional night at LaRanna where I had the Asiago cheese risotto with cauliflower)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->By now of course our pallets were in real need of cleansing.  So the maitre de brought out a round of lemon sorbet.  Of course sorbet alone would not work as well as sorbet with Grey Goose vodka poured over the top.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->With clean pallets we finally moved to the main course.  Potatos gratin with lobster, veal, and tornados of beef.  Plus some veggies thrown in for good measure.  I can only describe this course as a cruise size portion.  Each person had their own platter full of meat, potatos and veggies.  Everything was just great.  At this point we switched to a Wolf-Blass Shiraz to accompany the main course.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After the main course was done we moved on to the cheese course.  Roquefort balls and a bridge of parmesan cheese.  This was not my favorite course as the roquefort was really strong, and the parmesan bridge was &lsquo;more &lsquo;structural than edilble&rsquo; in the words of one of our dinner companions.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The next course was the true dessert course, presented by the ships pastry chef.  He had constructed a really nice Amaretto desert plate for us which was really a sculpture on a plate.   Desert was served with a delicious desert wine.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next we had our espresso or capucino served with some home made chocolates.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The grand finale was nice glass of limoncello.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After the meal was over the maitre de and photographer showed up.  Each couple got their picture taken with the chef and staff, and each &lsquo;lady&rsquo; recieved a cookbook.  Notably the gay couples did not receive any cookbooks!  This was rectified after one of the guys took the maitre de aside and explained that it probably wasn&rsquo;t fair for them to be excluded from the cookbook.  Since they paid the same as us and probably cooked just as much as the rest of us.  One of the guys was a professor at Loyala Marymount in LA and he and I talked a little college shop during the dinner.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->When one of the other guys found out I was leading a J-term trip to Silicon Valley during January he volunteered to connect me with a friend of his that works at Pixar!  Wow that would be an awesome dinner result if we are able to get a tour at Pixar.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>This morning started out like any other morning.  The alarm went off at 6:15 so that we could get up and get on our way to the everglades.  We left the Embassy Suites and walked down 17th Avenue toward the intercostal waterway where we were picking up our rental car.  On the way we split our forces with half of us going to Einstein&rsquo;s Bagel Shop and half to Starbucks for Tea, Chai Latte and Cocoa.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We beat the traffic heading out of town easily on our way to the Sawgrass recreation park.  It is part of the Everglades national park.  We had an appointment with Captain Randy and his airboat at 8:00.  Our instructions were to meet him 1/2 mile past mile marker 38 on highway 27.  We got there early, the sun was still pretty low in the sky and finished our breakfast in the small parking lot.  A few minutes later a pickup truck pulling an airboat with seating for nine pulled into the lot.  We watched as the captain fired up the 500 horsepower Corvette engine hooked up to a four blade airline propellor.  After the short checkout period he backed the boat and trailor into the water and brought the boat around to the ground.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We greeted Captain Randy, who showed us onto the boat and gave us a short intro to our safety equipment, which consisted of headphones to protect our eardrums from the sound of the engine and airplane prop.  He invited one of us to join him in the topmost pair of seats as the co-pilot.  We took off, and after a short lesson in steering the airboat, push forward for right and pull back for left, he turned the steering over to me.  Driving an airboat takes a lot more anticipation than driving a ski boat.  When you want to turn a corner on one of the trails in the everglades you need to start doing so a few seconds in advance.  Luckily if you cut the corner to sharp, or too late you really don&rsquo;t run into any problems.  You make the trail a little wider as you mow down the Sawgrass and cattail, but there seems to be enough of both to go around.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Taking the early morning trip was a great idea as the angle of the sun was just beautiful, and we saw hundreds of birds as we cruised through the trails.  We saw hawks, and herons, and vultures and birds of all different colors and varieties.   In addition to the birds we were always on the lookout for gators.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Captain Randy seems to have come from a long line of Everglades boat captains that have been involved with all kinds of dubious activities.  Pappy was an alligator poacher, and Randy and his brother kept small alligators as pets when they were younger.  As Captain Randy fed one of the gators along the way hotdogs and marshmallows he informed us that feeding the gators was strictly against the law.  That didn&rsquo;t stop him, and we got some great pictures of Randy feeding his Mi Amoure Catalyna.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Shortly after our gator feeding experience, we reached the farthest point on our tour.  By this point we were all pretty comfortable with the boat and so I was sitting in the bow taking pictures and the rest of the family was comfortably spread around.  Randy headed the boat down a narrow trail and suddenly I noticed that we were boating in mud instead of water.  As the mud got thicker and drier the boat went slower and slower until we finally came to a halt.  Stuck in the mud!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After trying to gun the giant engine on our airboat for many minutes Randy finally admitted that we were stuck and going to need some help getting out.  At this point we learned a couple of things about Randy&rsquo;s friend Lyle.  First, Lyle had an extremely long message on his business phone, and his cell phone.  Second we learned that Randy had helped Lyle out of a similar situation just a couple of days ago.  After failing to reach Lyle by phone we resorted to the old fashioned VHF radio.  &ldquo;Laxahatchie, Laxahatcie, Laxahatchie, Lyle this is Randy are you there, over&hellip;.&rdquo;  With those words our 3-hour tour became a rescue mission.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Our airboat was partway down a trail that had been drained of water.  We were about 150 feet onto the mud and it looked like the mud continued for another 300 before it rounded a bend.  The trick was to turn the airboat around and pull it out the short way.  Unfortunately in the Everglades walking on mud is not so easy.  When Randy got out of the boat to try and use a rope to turn us around he sunk up nearly to his waist.  To get back to the edge of the water required him to crawl on hands and knees to distribute his weight.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The four of us stayed in the boat feeling somewhat amused at our situation.  Clearly we were not in any sort of life threatening emergency but for Randy this was clearly a pain in the butt and probably somewhat of an embarrasment.  We were not dressed to jump in the mud and help him, although Kaia seemed very willing to do so.  Josh was protecting his new green and white Nikes that Grandpa Miller bought him for Christmas but other than that I think he would have helped too.   I had on a brand new pair of Tommy Bahama shorts that I was definitely not interested in getting covered in Everglades mud.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The rescuue mission was long and tedious as Lyle&rsquo;s big boat could not turn around at the end of our trail.  This required the help of a third airboat driven by a kind stranger.  The third boat acted as  a tug boat getting Lyle in the proper position and ferrying the rope into Randy when necessary.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The procedure that Randy and Lyle determined for getting us out involved tieing a line to the bow of the boat and then pulling with Lyle&rsquo;s larger airboat.  To a physicist this seemed like a dumb idea as the angles involved were all wrong, but neither Randy or Lyle were physicists so this was not an issue.  After breaking Randy&rsquo;s bowline there was some thought that the way to resolve the issue would be to bring a couple of pieces of plywood so that the tourists would be able to walk out of the trail but going from plank to plank and moving the planks as we made progress.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Walking the tourists out was not an acceptable plan to Captain Randy.   It was clear that Lyle&rsquo;s larger rope needed to be connected directly to the bow of our airboat and then threaded through the side of the boat about halfway back.  Randy decided that he would get to the side with a second rope and pull to try and provide the needed force vector to get the boat to turn to the side.  After several long pulls we finally had the boat turned at a ninty degree angle to our original course.  (This only took about three hours to get us to this position).<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We repositioned the rope to the bow of Randy&rsquo;s ship and he got in his captains chair.  At this point the plan was to have one last pull by Lyle with Randy ready to &ldquo;Give her Hell&rdquo; as soon as we were headed in roughly the right direction.  With this plan in mind and one last pull we were finally free!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Once free of the mud we followed Lyle back to his docking area where hugs were exchanged and many thumbs up were given to our kind helpers.   By this time Captain Randy had completely missed his 11:30 trip and was wanting to make sure we got back to the landing in time to meet his 2:30.  So we took off for home base at high speed.  After a while he slowed down so that Jane or Josh could drive.  Josh wanted to have nothing to do with driving as by this time he was convinced that he would do something even worse than get us stuck in the mud.  So Jane took her turn and did a great job of driving the boat.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Just before we got back to the landing we made one last stop with captain Randy to make sure that we had our stories straight.  Clearly he was a little nervous that his muddy appearance might be offputting to his next group.  Particularly if we were unhappy and complaining about the trip.  He really had no reason to worry, all of us thought the trip was a great adventure.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->After our exciting airboat trip we planned to stop at the Sawgrass Mill, an enormous shopping center.  It took us almost a half hour of driving around to find the Ron Jon outlet store.  Even after we found it it took forever to get in because the parking lot was so busy and full.  The plan was for us to stop there to get Kaia a swimming suit.  Since I had discovered that my old suit was too big for me I decided to get one too.  Josh also found himself a nice suit and a football for using in the water.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The next big surprise of the night came when we walked over to Pazzo&rsquo;s for an italian dinner.  We walked in the door and talked to the hostess who told us to wait just a minute as she checked the tables.  As we stood waiting for a minute a familiar figure came across the bar headed toward us.  Sasan Mokhtari and his family were in the restaurant!  they were in town for the soccer tournament.  It was really fun to reconnect with Sasan after several years.  We had a great talk with Sasan and Mary and their kids Tara, Eva, and Daniel.  Tara is a first year at MIT and Eva and Daniel have transferred to Breck.   It took Sasan only about 3 minutes to ask me if I would be interested in doing some consulting for him!<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We had a great meal, although Josh was feeling a little sick and didn&rsquo;t eat very much.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Here&rsquo;s a little script that combines two of my favorite pass times.  Python programming and cycling.  bonktown.com is a great site that has steep discounts on road cycling gear.  They only sell one item at a time and they typically sell that item until it is gone.  I&rsquo;ve gotten some great deals on clothing and other stuff on that site.  Bonktown helps you know whats currently for sale in a number of ways, including a nice dashboard widget that pops up a notifier when something new comes on sale.  The problem is that over time I&rsquo;ve started to ignore the growl notifiers for bonktown, because I&rsquo;m not interested in lots of the stuff they sell.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, I wrote this python script that allows me to look for the stuff I am interested in buying.

			 <p>After all of our hiking and rafting adventure we are ending the trip with 3 days of rest and relaxation in Sedona.  Our major activities here are a Pink Jeep tour, Golfing, and a massage for the women in the family.  Otherwise we are doing lots of pool time and have even played a hand or two of 500.  Sedona is known for its red rock and beautiful scenery, along with crystal shops and the Ye Olde UFO Shoppe.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We did the Broken Arrow tour with Pink Jeep, which was fun.

I played so well that I had to buy a new shirt to commemorate the occasion.  It was 25% off for fathers day so happy fathers day to me.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jane and Kaia both had facials and hot stone massages.  I can&rsquo;t go into any more detail about that. :-)  But they were both glowing and relaxed when they got back.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Tonight we are going to go out for some barbeque and then come back to the room and get packed for the final leg of our journey.

			 <p>The call for &ldquo;Hooaaahhht Coffeeeeee&rdquo; went out at 4:30AM.  It was already twilight in the East and it was time to pack up camp and get on the rafts for the final 3/4 mile of our journey.  We had all come a long way on this trip.  From the first night where everyone managed to find a place to sleep in private, this last night looked like a refugee camp.  We didn&rsquo;t have much room and everyone slept right next to everyone else.  Here you can see everyone&rsquo;s gear and a corner of what we at first called the &ldquo;Miller plot&rdquo; and then renamed to Miller Estate.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here you can see the bridge that connects the Kaibab trail from the North to the South wall.  We went a little further downstream to Phantom Ranch and crossed our own bridge.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The facts of the Phantom Ranch trail are as follows:  Its a 10 mile hike from the river to the rim.  It is a 1 mile vertical difference from the river to the rim.  Now the mathematically inclined will say that is only a 10% grade.  Not a problem&hellip;  It was a challenge.  They tell you to have two one liter water bottles and to fill them full at the bottom.  there is a halfway stop called Indian Gardens with a water station and a 3 mile (from the top) stop with a water station and a 1.5 mile stop with a water station.  We filled our water at every stop.  You do drink a LOT of water on this hike.  You are also advised to rest for 30 minutes at each stop if you are having difficulty.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We left the river at 7AM and were to Indian Gardens by 10:30.  This is going well we thought.  Unfortunately when you get to Indian Gardens you have only gone 1/4 of the vertical distance.  We finally arrived at the rim at 3:30.  We made a lot of extra stops on the last half of the hike.  Jane did not drink enough water during the first half and was struggling a bit during the second part of the hike.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->In fact with half a mile remaining she was completely pooped.  We asked one of our fellow hikers to send Josh back to carry Jane&rsquo;s pack the last half mile.  Josh wins the good sport award for the day.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now you might wonder is the hike worth it for all that work?  Yes, absolutely you get to see the Canyon in a way that you just can&rsquo;t imagine by looking down from the rim.  Here you can see some of the trail we came up.  But not all the way to the river that is hidden in the distance.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pictures don&rsquo;t do justice to the amazing beauty of this corner of the world.  We are all really glad we did this trip.  As I&rsquo;m writing this from the comfort of the Sedona Hilton, I&rsquo;m inspired by the message on my plastic Gin and Tonic glass which says that &ldquo;Travel is not about getting from point A to B, Travel should renew your zest for life.&rdquo;  This trip has certainly done that.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>For three days we had a great raft trip with Wilderness River Adventures.  The trip was amazing!  For three days we saw the Grand Canyon in a way that few are lucky enough to see, from the bottom up.  As we rafted along we literally saw the history of the world from today to 2 billion years ago.  The beauty of this place is just awe inspiring.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We began our trip at Lee&rsquo;s Ferry, just south of Page Arizona and ended up at Phantom Ranch at the bottom of the Grand Canyon.  We shared the trip with another small group (Rocky, Joe, and Denise) and one large group from Lafayette College.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The Lafeyette group really made the trip for us.  The group of Geology students was led by Dr. Larry Malinconico (Dr. M) and Dr. Dave Sunderlin.  In my slightly biased opinion I thought that Luther students were the friendliest students anywhere.  The group from Lafeyette taught me that there are other colleges with really great students.  Not only did we learn a lot from lurking in the back of the impromptu lectures but we had a great time getting to know them all.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here are a couple of examples of how beautiful the canyon is.  Here we are in calm water:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here was one of our short day hikes.  You can see our rafts to the right.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course no rafting trip would be complete without the opportunity to get wet, which we are about to do here:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->And no trip report from me would be complete without a review of the food.  In a word, awesome.  Here are the two swampers (Kari and Everett) preparing our last dinner.  Spaghetti and meatballs, or Alfredo Sauce.  We had Salmon and rice one night, grilled New York Strips and Baby Red Potatoes another night.  It was all &ldquo;good eats&rdquo;.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The leaders of the trip were Richard and Matt. Two excellent raft drivers.  Not sure what the proper term is for the captain of a giant rubber raft.  But they got us safely through some really &ldquo;fun&rdquo; rapids.  At one point the Miller family did experience a collective flashback to being stranded in the Everglades when our raft got hung up on Whale Rock.  This was right in the middle of the biggest rapids of the trip and we were just starting to wonder how we were going to get rescued when the raft freed itself and we were on our way.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The sleeping accomodations were better than expected by my standards.  For three nights we just slept on our mats under the stars.  No tents, just sleeping bags, tarps and mats.  It was great.  Since Arizona does not observe daylight savings time, it was dark by 8:30PM and light by 5:00 AM.  So it was an early to bed early to rise kind of trip.  One night I woke up at midnight and got out the camera.  This picture doesn&rsquo;t really do justice to the beauty of the night sky in Arizona but it gives you some idea of what we saw from our sleeping bags:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The last day of our trip we got up at 4:30AM and went about half a mile downstream to Phantom Ranch.  From there we hiked 10 miles linearly and 1 mile vertically to get out of the Grand Canyon.  I&rsquo;ll cover that experience in another post.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>The other day I discovered that the folks working on VPython have been very busy over the last couple of years.  I had given up on VPython because the Mac distribution was so difficult to use.  It required the X windows server and one point and lots of other extra junk at other times.  But now things are easy!  There is a great installer package and it just works.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For those of you who have not heard of VPython before it is a 3D graphics module called visual built on top of Python and OpenGL.  You can do a lot of nice 3D graphics very simply with VPython.  Its great for education in math and physics and introductory computer science.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->So as an experiment I built a turtle graphics module on top of VPython.  I use turtle graphics a lot in teaching but the TKinter turtles all suffer from some event loop problems when you use them with IDLE.  VPython does not suffer from this problem plus gives you a lot of other cool benefits.  One of the benefits is that the window resizes automatically for you based on the units you use in your application.  Want to draw a picture at the atomic level of detail?  No problem, want to draw planets circling each other?  Again no problem.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s a screen capture of a fractal tree created in 3-D using my new turtle.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Here&rsquo;s the VPython turtle code:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->def tree(t,trunkLength):<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    if trunkLength &lt; 5:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        return<!-- raw HTML omitted -->    else:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        turnDz = random.randint(20,40)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        turnDx = random.randint(20,40)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        trunkShort = random.randint(10,20)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        t.width(trunkLength/10.0)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        if trunkLength &lt; 25:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->            t.color(color.green)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        else:<!-- raw HTML omitted -->            t.color((174/255.0,145/255.0,0))<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        t.forward(trunkLength)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        # right trunk<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        t.right(turnDz,ZAXIS)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        tree(t,trunkLength-trunkShort)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        # left trunk<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        t.left(2<em>turnDz,ZAXIS)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        tree(t,trunkLength-trunkShort)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        # front trunk<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        t.right(turnDz,ZAXIS)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        t.right(turnDx,XAXIS)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        tree(t,trunkLength-trunkShort)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        # back trunk<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        t.left(2</em>turnDx,XAXIS)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        tree(t,trunkLength-trunkShort)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        # restore<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        t.right(turnDx,XAXIS)<!-- raw HTML omitted -->        t.backward(trunkLength)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If you want to check out the turtle module and play with it, you are welcome to do so:  hg clone <a href="http://bitbucket.org/bnmnetp/vturtle">bitbucket.org/bnmnetp/v&hellip;</a>  Or send me mail.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

			 <p>Although the weather back home may have been below zero, in Northern california he sun was out and it was 68 degrees.  Perfect weather for a bikeride.

<p>Not much to report today. We got up and rode the shuttle to the airport,

Now we are sitting in the O&rsquo;hare terminal hoping that everything will
continue to be on-time for today.</p>
<p>We told the kids this morning that they were essentially getting up at
midnight back in Iowa. So by the time we get hope tonight (hopefully by
7pm) they will have been up 19 hours. Josh of course immediately
volunteered to stay up until midnight just so he could say he had stayed
up 24 hours.</p>

			 <h1 id="a-day-in-brussels">A Day in Brussels</h1>
<p>We got up early this morning so we could have our breakfast and catch a
cab to the Leonardo DaVinci airport. We had ordered a cab the night
before so it was waiting for us right at 7:30. We arrived at the airport
in plenty of time and got our first taste of how they allocate checkin
space in a european airport. The trick is that all the checkin desks are
common and the airlines are just assigned a desk or two for their
flights for the day. After some looking we finally figured this out and
found a display board that told us the number of the desk that Brussels
Airline was working from.</p>
<p>After some initial difficulties with their computers we finally moved to
a new desk and got checked in. Three security checkpoints later we were
waiting at our gate for our flight to be called. The Brussels Air plane
was an old 737 that was a 3 and 3 configuration with about 6 inches of
legroom.</p>
<p>We arrived at the Brussels airport and were reminded how nice and new
and clean it seems. After all the initial security in rome we were
surprised that we did not need to go through customs or passport control
after arriving in Brussels. In order to get our luggage we had to walk a
very long way, after getting our luggage it was a very short walk to the
hotel shuttles and our holiday inn van had just arrived.</p>
<p>The Holiday Inn was quite nice. The lobby was clean and nice and they
had Internet! We were initially disappointed with our non-smoking room
that smelled like an all night poker game had just wrapped up, but after
opening the window and putting the air conditioner on vent it didn&rsquo;t
take very long to get things aired out to the point where it was OK.</p>
<p>In addition to the swimming pool the pool area also had a hot tub. This
was a great way to relax a bit and any thoughts of catching a train to
downtown for more site seeing vanished. We ate at the hotel bar for
supper as we didn&rsquo;t really feel like paying 40 euros for the evening
buffet. Josh and I had a bacon cheeseburger, Kaia had pureed vegetable
soup and pasta, Jane had shrimp skewers. The kids were very excited
because they could get chocolate milk! Their first milk in many days.
Jane and I had draft beers of the local Leffe variety. I had &lsquo;Leffe
brune&rsquo; and Jane had &lsquo;Leffe Blonde.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After dinner we retired to the room for a final night of 500. Josh and I
were victorious again! We won two games quite convincingly with Josh
carrying me on his back most of the way.</p>

			 <h1 id="ancient-rome">Ancient Rome</h1>
<p>We could subtitle today Information Overload. We spent today with our
guide Tony and learned so much it is almost impossible to describe.</p>
<p>The major sites on our itinerary for today included: - Church of San
Clemente - Flavian Amphitheater (Colloseum) - Roman Forum - Lunch on the
Apian Antica - The Catacombes</p>
<dl>
<dt>Things we learned today:</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Christmas and the Saturnalia. At the temple of Saturn we learned
that christmas</li>
<li>Spaghetti Westerns</li>
<li>San Clemente</li>
<li>San Lorenzo (patron saint of cooks)</li>
<li>The founding of Rome and the vestal virgins</li>
<li>Story of San Sebastian</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>After our long day of touring we finally walked next door to the hotel
to see the pantheon. It was cool but after a full day of interesting
stories and explanations from tony it was a bit of a letdown. Kaia
really wanted to visit some of the exclusive shops along the street near
the Spanish Steps. We had also decided that Kaia needed something to
replace the green duffle that had been causing troubles the whole trip.
So we found a relatively inexpensive piece that was larger than her
carryon size at a shop along the way.</p>
<p>Josh and I were charged with bringing the luggage back to the hotel
while Jane and Kaia continued on their shopping quest. I told Jane to
buy me a new pen at the Mont Blanc store, but with prices starting at
over 300 euros she and Kaia were too intimidated to even go in the
store!</p>
<p>After our day of touring and shopping we headed for our dinner
reservation at Alfredos Originale. The home of Fettucine Alfredo! Kaia
was so excited she could hardly stand it, for her it was like a
religious pilgrimage. I was also excited to see how my recipe compared
with Alfredo&rsquo;s. Alfredo&rsquo;s was good but very different from mine. It
was very light on the cream, but heavier on the butter and Parmiagano
Reggiano.</p>

			 <h1 id="touring-the-vatican">Touring the Vatican</h1>
<p>The day started out on a bad note when Tony called to tell us that our
guide for the day was sick. So, instead of touring the ancient roman
ruins we decided to tour the vatican museum on our own. We decided that
would be the easiest place to do an audio tour to get the most out of
the day without a guide.</p>
<p>Before leaving the hotel we asked the concierge for dinner
recommendations for someplace indian or Thai. We are so burned out on
pasta that we are delaying our long anticipated trip to Alfredo&rsquo;s (home
of fettucine alfredo) until tomorrow night. We have a recommendation for
an Indian restaurant called Maharajah. The concierge will make
reservations while we are touring today.</p>
<p>The Vatican and St. Peters are within pretty easy walking distance of
our hotel so we have a quick breakfast in the hotel breakfast salon and
then head out. Even though it is just 9:00 the crowds are 2/3 of the way
around the outer ring of statues at St. Peters when we get there. Not
being very prepared we just get in back of the line and prepare
ourselves for a wait.</p>
<p>After about 2 minutes in line we hear an english voice asking people
near us if they would like to avoid the long lines and get a tour of the
vatican in english. The 10:00 tour is just starting he said. We knew
this was a bit of a risk, but since we had already committed to pay for
a guide today we figured this would be better than standing in line all
day and trying to follow an audio tour through the vatican museum.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a reasonably good decision. Our guide was a young
women from Canada named Sandra who graduated with an art history degree
from Queens college in Canada. The tour only cost 13 euros per person
plus entry into the museum. In the end Josh did not cost anything and
kaia was reduced price.</p>
<p>We started the tour in front of the Obelisk in St. Peters square. This
obelisk came from Egypt as a gift many years ago. The egyptions asked
for it back and rome refused. Unfortunately the the obelisk was not
centered properly in front of St. Peters and so the pope decided it must
be moved. The obelisk weighed 300 metric tons and 500 romans showed up
to help move the obelisk. thousands of romans showed up to watch and the
pope swore everyone to silence under pain of death so that the workmen
could concentrate. (the only time that many romans have ever been quiet)
After they had moved the obelisk, but just as they were raising it into
its new position the ropes started to fray. everyone was absolutely
silent until one man broke his vow to yell out that they should put
water on the ropes to lubricate them. This saved the day and the man was
not beheaded but was given a yearly salary in gratitude from the pope.</p>
<p>After that short story we walked around and away from St. Peters to the
American Bar where we paid our guide and she told us that once we had
paid here she would go stand in the security line to hold our places for
approximately 40 minutes, after which time we could join her in the
line. This was the point where more than one person in the group became
a little suspicious that we might never find her in the line once we
handed over the cash. 30 gullible tourists at 38 dollars a pop would be
a pretty good mornings work!</p>
<p>Nevertheless Sandra was there in line or us 40 minutes later and even a
bit longer than that as the security line was moving slowly this
morning. After getting into the museum we realized that the really long
line we were in this morning was only for the free visit to St. Peters
and we could have come over here ourselves. Nevertheless Having Sandra
as our guide turned out to be great. We learned a lot from her about the
things that we stopped to see. She explained to us right away that this
was just going to be the highlights and we would not stop to see
everything. In fact to see everything in the museum for 45 seconds would
take 10 years.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>pine cone garden</li>
<li>the body statue -- inspiration for Rodin&rsquo;s The Thinker</li>
<li>Nero&rsquo;s bathtub</li>
<li>The Rafael rooms - Michaelangelos rival that painted the scholars</li>
<li>The Sistine Chapel</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>By the time we got out of the Sistine chapel it was 3:30 and our two
hour tour had lasted four and a half hours. We came right out of the
chapel by the line to take the elevator up to the stairs leading up the
cupola. Another 320 stairs to climb to the very top. the view from the
top of St. Peter&rsquo;s was spectacular.</p>
<p>After the climb and the view and the heat we were all more than a little
dehydrated and hungry, luckily there was a (rather expensive) snack bar
part of the way down. we bought some pop and water and then took some
pictures by the statues of the apostles. when we got to the bottom of
the stairs we came right out into the basilica so we looked around for a
while but decided to pass on the trip through the crypt. We headed back
towards our hotel with the idea of getting a snack along the way.</p>
<p>For dinner tonight we had a reservation at Maharajah, an Indian
Restaurant. It was such a nice change of pace that everyone thought the
food was delicious. Josh and Kaia had Chicken Shahi Korma. I had the
Madras chicken curry. I was going to order the vindaloo chicken again
but the manager told me that vindaloo was the hottest, 80% chili peppers
and 20% tomatoe. The Madras was second hottest and was hot enough for
me. Jane had a dish caled &lsquo;Murg Peshwari&rsquo; a Kashmiri style curry with
oriental herbs, capsicum, onion and tomato. Josh seemed to like that one
even more than the chicken Korma. We are making a curry lover out of him
yet.</p>
<p>The restaurant was about a 20 minute walk from our hotel so we had time
to stop for a gelato on the way home. We had a chance to see the Tivoli
fountain just as it was getting dark. We were all very tired after a
long hot day of walking so we were ready for bed by 10:00.</p>

			 <h1 id="mamma-mia-we-are-in-pompei">Mamma Mia We are in Pompei</h1>
<p>This morning dawned bright and sunny. Once again the view of the Bay of
Naples from our deck was spectacular. As we were eating breakfast we saw
a cruise ship coming into the harboor. it looked like they would be
tendering directly into Sorrento.</p>
<p>We got up early so we could meet our guide for a tour of Pompei. We
arrived at Pompei right at 8:30, purchased our tickets, and looked for
our guide. It turned out that we were looking for her in the wrong
place. She was at the Camping Zeus parking lot (where we parked) and we
were at the gate.</p>
<p>Our guides name was Patricia (Pah Tree tsee aah). She gave us a very
good tour and turned out to be very quotable.</p>
<p>Moma Mia its hot! Moma Mia we must get away from the enemy (the other
tourists)</p>
<p>Pompei was hot and busy even though we were some of the first people in
line for tickets. But it was still very interesting and a fun tour
again. It was even better after having read Harrison&rsquo;s book about
Pompei.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Highlights of Pompei</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>theater</li>
<li>the baths</li>
<li>houses</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>After the tour Patricia gave us a lunch recommendation for a restaurant
right near the Cameo factory we had visited five years ago. She
introduced us as her friends to the Maitre De and told him to take good
care of us. We got off to a very good start when Jane asked for a Coke
Light and he responded that they had Pepsi! Our first Diet Pepsi in many
days! After that the rest of the lunch, Napoli style pizza was really
irrelevant.</p>
<p>We walked around a few of the shops and then headed for our car. We knew
we were a little ahead of schedule but there really was not time for any
additional touring if we wanted to be in Rome by 5:00.</p>
<p>Thankfully I had been able to follow the directions the guy at Renault
gave me and programmed in the right location for the drop off. It was in
the same area as the airport but was next to a cow pasture! The office
seemed to be some kind of cheap warehouse space they had rented with a
bit of covered parking for the returned vehicles. After we inspected our
car and signed over the lease the attendant drove us to the airport and
dropped us off near the taxi line.</p>
<p>We headed for the start of the taxi queue and were met by a driver who
told us it would be 90 euros for a ride downtown for all four of us with
our luggage. That was much higher than we expected so we went inside to
regroup and try to learn about the Rome shuttle service we had read
about. We finally gave up and decided to pay the 90 dollars to just get
going. On our way to the line we ran into a driver who told us he would
take us for 65 euros. He appeared to be wearing a taxi drivers license
around his neck, but he took us to the parking lot rather than the taxi
line. We were really wondering if this guy was legit but he got us
downtown in just 35 minutes for the agreed on price.</p>
<p>Our hotel, Albergo Santa Chiara, is right behind the Pantheon. When we
checked in, the two managers were looking at us and their list of
customers and speaking angrily as if to say &lsquo;what are we going to do
with them?&rsquo; I think it worked in our favor as they gave us one of their
three apartments. We have a main room with TV and two pull out beds, a
middle room with another bed, bathroom, and kitchen. However the porter
told us &ldquo;chicken is locked.&rdquo; Finally, we have a master bedroom. So we
have a great room for our last three nights of touring.</p>
<p>We all agreed that we were really really tired of pasta and heavy
italian food. Unfortunately we did not have our Rick Steve&rsquo;s book nor
had we asked at the front desk about alternative food sources. So we
settled for walking to Piazza Navonna to see what they had. We found a
restaurant that offered hamburgers and chicken along with traditional
italian food.</p>
<p>As we were sitting at our table waiting for service Kaia noticed a man
drawing caricatures in the middle of the piazza. She went to talk to the
guy who told her he would draw both of them for 20 euros. So, while we
waited for our food Josh and Kaia each had a caricature drawn. They are
both very good. Josh is a soccer player and Kaia is a runner.</p>
<p>Since we were seated on the outside table right next the the main
traffic around the Piazza we were inundated with sales people trying to
sell us flowers, and all kinds of glowing and buzzing things. In
addition we had fun watching the people selling scarves and fake Prada
purses playing cat and mouse with the two police officers patrolling the
piazza. Everytime they would get their bags arranged on the side walk we
would suddenly see a wave of them scooping up bags and heading down the
sidewalk. Followed by one of the officers. As quickly as the officer
passed they were back putting their wares down again.</p>

<p>Today we had a very long drive. We left Tuscany and headed all the way
south bypassing Rome and Naples to Sorrento. This is the small city that
we stopped at on our cruise with Brian and Holly five years ago so we
were excited to see the city again and try to find a few of the places
we remembered.</p>
<p>Our hotel, Settimo Cielo, was nice and clean but not spectacular. The
View from the deck off our hotel room WAS spectacular. The hotel is
built right into the side of the cliff overlooking the Bay of Naples.
Looking out at the ships and the lights along the bay was really nice.</p>
<p>The hotel also had a small pool which gave the kids a chance to cool off
and burn off some of the energy they had accumulated over the long drive
from Tuscany. They had the coolest lounge chairs by the pool. Each chair
had its own little adjustable sun shade built into it so if you wanted
to read and shade your face you could flip it up and adjust it
accordingly.</p>
<p>After we had rested up we walked into the shopping district in search of
a nice bottle of Limoncello. We actually found one in the shape of a
cello and so we have that as a nice souvenir to bring home. The streets
were as narrow as I remembered, but were much more crowded than I
remembered from a few years ago.</p>
<p>We thought we had a good general idea of where the restaurant we had
eaten at was but it took us a few false starts before we finally found
the right place. The restaurant is called La Lanterna and they seemed
very happy that we had come back to have dinner with them again after
five years. The food was good, but not as good as our memories had
created. But we have had some exceptional meals on this trip and I think
pasta burnout was starting to set in. I had some really nice Cannelonni
which could have and should have been enough. Instead I had some Red
Snapper for my secondi which was a bit on the tough and fishy side.</p>
<p>After dinner we walked back to our hotel to get a good night sleep
knowing that we had to get going early in the morning.</p>

<p>Today the sun was out and it looked like it was going to be our first
beautiful dry clear day. A good day to hang around the apartment and do
laundry. Maybe today we actually had a chance to get everything to dry
for us!</p>
<p>After doing laundry and reading, I finished <em>Three Cups of Tea</em> this
morning, we headed in to Monteone for some lunch and hoping to find an
internet point. We arrived on an extremely slow day the weekly market
was just closing down when we arrived but almost everything else in town
was closed. No internet point, not public library. We had a small lunch
at someplace fairly forgettable.</p>
<p>We had one of the nicest dinners of the trip tonight at Casa Masi just
down the road from Il Lebbio. We definitely are getting the hang of
european dinners and we had a little something from every course. For
our antipasti we had some bruschetti for primi I had pici pasta with a
beautiful meat sauce, and kaia and josh had pici with a sheep cheese and
basil. Definitely worth trying to find some pici pasta to use at home!
For the Secondi We had steak, Jane and I both had fillet with a porcini
mushroom on top. Actually the mushroom was the only disappointment as it
was a bit mushy. For dolci Kaia and I had an amazingly rich chocolate
cake, and josh had a fruit pudding. I also ordered a little Grappa as a
digestif. We could have and should have walked home after dinner to work
off the calories!</p>
<p>Tonight Josh and I finally recorded our first victory in 500! After days
of bad cards we were finally victorious.</p>

			 <h1 id="cinque-terre">Cinque Terre</h1>
<p>The word for today is &lsquo;Schiapito,&rsquo; which in english means strike. The
strike I am talking about is a gas strike. Something I had never heard
about before. But had the effect of putting damper on what was otherwise
an absolutely beautiful day.</p>
<p>We took off by 8:00 this morning toward Cinque Terre which is an italian
national park consisting of 5 small villages along the Mediterranean. To
get there we drove two hours to La Spezia to take a short 10 minute
train ride to Riomaggiore, the first of the cities. As we got into La
Spezia it started to rain. We were also down to 1/8 of a tank of gas. As
we drove through town I noticed that all the gas stations were closed.
This was very curious to me until Jane said rather offhandedly &lsquo;they do
have gas strikes in Italy occasionally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As usual it was difficult to find parking around the train station, but
after driving around for a while we found one relatively close. We got
our tickets and hopped the first train to Riomaggiore. When we got there
the clouds were at about 500 feet and we heard thunder. In Riomaggiore
you walk through a short tunnel and then take an elevator to the top of
the town. From the top there is a beautiful view of the ocean, mountains
and vineyards surrounding this little town.</p>
<p>Our plan for the day was to hike the trails between the first 4 of the
five cities and then take the train to the last city to avoid the most
difficult part of the hike. Unfortunately it started to POUR as we were
walking down main street. So, rather than stand in the middle of the
road under our umbrellas we got a covered seat and bought some hot
chocolate. While sitting at the table we heard a couple of guys from
Virginia talking. They said they left Rome a day early to avoid the gas
strike. When I asked them about the strike they said &lsquo;didn&rsquo;t you
hear!?&rsquo; &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t buy any gas until tomorrow morning at 7AM.&rsquo; This
didn&rsquo;t do my worry gene any good at all so we started looking into
getting a hotel room right there in Riomaggiore. No pajamas, no clean
clothes, no toothbrush or anything. A real adventure. The first two
places we checked were completely booked, but the third place had a
small apartment available. When I inquired about the gas strike she told
me that stations on the autostrada and some 24 hour stations would be
open after 7:00 that night. So after some thought we decided to postpone
our confirmation of the apartment. We confirmed her information about
the gas strike and availability of gas at the national park office.</p>
<p>So, feeling as relieved as I could in a country where we don&rsquo;t
understand the news we set out on our hike in a very light drizzle. The
first part of the hike, between Riomaggiore and Manarola is a very easy
and short walk on a well paved trail. The best news was as we were
hiking along we could see blue sky offshore headed our direction! There
was not much to see in Manarola so we continued our hike toward
Corniglia. This leg of the hike was only slightly more difficult and a
little longer, until we arrived at the Corniglia train station. To get
from the train station to the main part of town you could either walk a
winding road or take 500 stairs!</p>
<p>Having hoped, but missing, the shuttle bus We opted for the road over
the stairs. At the top of the stairs we found the pretty town square and
the restaurant Cecio! Pesto was invented here in Cinque Terre so of
course there were lots of pesto options on the menu. It was very good!
Josh and Kaia had pesto spagetti; Jane and I had linguine with pesto. We
ate outside under an awning and had a beautiful view down the valley to
the ocean.</p>
<p>One of the most remarkable things is the walls in this area. There are
literally thousands of walls built to make it possible to grow grapes
and other fruits and vegetables. It would take Shane and his crew a
hundred years to build all those walls. We also saw some cute little
&lsquo;roller coaster&rsquo; vehicles, single rail electric powered cars for
getting the crops up and down the sides of the hills. We saw oranges and
lemons and lots of other vegetation.</p>
<p>After lunch and some wine we headed off toward city number four,
Vernazza. This was definitely the longest and most difficult part of the
hike for the day. And the sun came out in full force just in time to get
us all hot and steamy along the way. The hike was even slower and more
difficult than usual because of the mud and slippery rocks. However,
along the way we had some spectacular views!</p>
<p>The hike to Vernazza took us an hour and forty five minutes and we were
all very glad to get to town to find some drinks and gelato. We also
found two other fun items for purchase. At a gastronome we bought some
pesto in a jar, along with some special noodles produced in Cinque
Terre. These noodles resemble communion wafers more than anything else
so it will be fun to cook them when we get home. Across the street in a
clothing store I found a pair of Capri pants, so now I can look &lsquo;tres
european.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Vernazza also has a small beach, so Jane and I sat on the bench while
the kids waded in the water. We had fun watching the kids and a golden
retriever who raced around the beach with the same enthusiasm as Alley
races around the backyard. The golden seemed to think its job was to
keep the beach free of Pigeons! It was great fun watching him chase from
one side to the other leaping at the Pigeons just as they took off to
get out of his way. Eventually the Pigeons gave up and found a quieter
beach somewhere else. Kaia adopted the dog as her new friend and spent
some time petting and talking to him.</p>
<p>Finally, we decided to catch the 6:28 train to Monterosso al Mare, the
most touristy of the five cities. We only spent about 45 minutes in town
walking around and looking at the beaches before we caught the 7:24
train back to La Spezia and our 1/4 tank of gas.</p>
<p>We headed out straight out of town for the Autostrasse hoping that the
information we had received was correct. I was worried that La Spezia
would not be a very nice place to spend the night. As we approached the
entrance area to the highway the sign still showed that there was a
strike and no gas was available on the way to Pisa. We kept going,
hoping that maybe we would find something. The first station we saw did
indeed look closed but the second station was an Agip and we saw cars by
the pumps! We pulled in and saw two attendents standing out by the
pumps. When the first asked if we wanted a fill up I answered &lsquo;YES
FULL&rsquo; the kids say it is difficult to capture the depth of the emotion
and relief in my voice when I said that and dubbed that the quote of the
day. I was indeed happy and very relieved to have a full tank of gas.</p>
<p>It was a good lesson. It is amazing how much we take the availability of
gasoline for granted. I don&rsquo;t think anything like a gas strike could
happen in the USA and I&rsquo;m interested to read more when we get home to
understand the motivation and background behind these periodic strikes
here in Italy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the gas station did not have any snacks and everyone was
looking forward to a bit of junk food at this point. We noticed along
the way that several gas stations looked like the pumps were working
even though the station houses themselves were closed up tight. So, we
continued to our apartment and had a junk food supper of chips, salsa,
cheese and crackers. Parmigiano Reggiano is very good on crackers and
flat bread!</p>

			 <h1 id="lunch-in-sienna">Lunch in Sienna</h1>
<p>Today we planned to be a light day. We did not get up too early and our
only goal was to drive to another hill town called Siena. Jane and I had
watched a video about the town so we were excited to see the square in
person. The square in Siena is the sight of an annual horse race where
they clear out all the restaurant tables and fill the outer ring of the
square with dirt for the race.</p>
<p>We arrived in time for a late lunch in the square. Rather than picking a
more expensive restaurant somewhere in town we opted for sitting along
the square and watching the people. It was fun, although the lunch was
not all that exciting. Jane and I had Lasagne al Forno and Josh and Kaia
each had a Salami and Fontina Panini.</p>
<p>After lunch it started to rain, so we lost our desire to wander around
the hill towns of Tuscany. We wandered by a few shops on our way out of
town but our hearts just were not in the shopping or sight seeing today.</p>
<p>We headed for our apartment hoping that maybe the weather there had been
better. Unfortunately the puddles and gutters of rain told us
differently. So we stayed around the apartment and read, Josh tried a
Sudoku, then got Kaia to play Cribbage with him.</p>
<p>While we were waiting around, the gardener showed up with some Italian
guy that we can only guess was the plumber, come to fix the hot water
heater. neither of them spoke any english so there was really nothing to
do but show them to the bathroom and see what happened. They left abut
10 minutes later, and miraculously the water heater seems to work 100%
better.</p>
<p>For dinner tonight we wanted to try Casa Masi again. We arrived at a
little before 7:30 but it was full so we made a reservation for friday
night. We decided to give Il Lago a try. Il Lago means the lake and Il
Lago was a restaurant built around a small lake. We quickly realized
that this was not so much a restaurant as it was a place to hold a
wedding and wedding reception if you come to Tuscany for that sort of
thing. We were seated in a large glassed in room with many tables and
only one overworked italian grandmother to wait on us.</p>
<p>Dinner was mostly forgettable. Kaia only ordered tagliatelli basilica
which was pretty good. Josh ordered a steak, Jane ordered Gnudi, which
was good, and misto of rabbit, chicken, lamb and vegetables. It all came
deep fried which made it hard to figure out what was what. I ordered
crostini to start followed by tagliatelli with mushroom pan sauce
followed by steak. By the time I got my steak everyone else had finished
all their courses. Maybe the best thing we had was an order of pommes
frittes which we saw another table order. Thinking they would be good
with steak I asked for some but they came before I even got my pasta so
they were long gone by the time my steak showed up. We arrived home at
10:00 tired and ready for a day of hiking tomorrow.</p>

			 <h1 id="climbing-around-firenze">Climbing Around Firenze</h1>
<p>Since cars are not allowed in or around the central part of Firenzi the
best way for us to go was to drive to a commuter town and take the
train. So we got up and drove to the town of Empoli. It is definitely a
commuter town as we had a heck of a time finding a parking spot since we
got there about 9am. We got our ticket and took a slow roller into
Firenze Santa Maria Novella station. This is the station where all the
books warn you about pick pockets. Luckily we made it in and out
unscathed.</p>
<p>When we got off the train we made straight for The science museum. Since
it was Tuesday the museum was only open until 13:00. It was great, this
will definitely be one of the highlights of the trip for me. Anyone who
is interested in Physics would love this museum. There are exhibits of
real early scientific instruments including astrolabes, Sextants, early
batteries, Galileo&rsquo;s first and second telescopes, early microscopes,
the list goes on. Every one of them is a great example of early science
and many of them are really illustrative of important discoveries in
Physics.</p>
<p>We finished our tour of the science museum just in time for lunch. So we
took another Rick Steve&rsquo;s recommendation and went for a late lunch at
the Golden Wall -- Open Bar. It was great. They gave us a table right
on a corner window where we could look out at the Arno river and the
Ponte Veccio. We watched several groups of rowers out for their daily
exercise and enjoyed a good lunch. Kaia had a pear and cheese salad
followed by Ravioli stuffed with Ricotta and Basil, I had Bruschetta con
quattro formagio e Truffles for my first course followed by Gnocchi with
Sausage and mushrooms. Josh had a Mezzaluna (part pizza part Calzone),
and Jane had fresh Mozzarela with Basil and Tomatoes followed by a
foccacia of Mozzarella and Tomatoes. It was a bit much of the same for
Jane between the first and second courses. Overall a good meal.</p>
<p>After we were fortified with a good lunch we decided to find the Duomo.
We lucked out and caught a relatively short line for climbing to the
top. The line was much shorter than the climb to the top. 463 Stairs!
The first part of the climb was pretty standard fair, some spiral
staircases... We had a nice break in the middle where we could view the
dome from the inside and look down into the sanctuary. As we got closer
to the top the stairs got steeper and steeper and we lost the spiral
approach and started spiraling around the dome itself. The rise was
almost one foot by the time we got to the very where we were climbing
along the very top of the dome itself.</p>
<p>Much of the climb followed the stairs between the two layers of the
dome. The inner layer is very thick, and the outer layer is only 82 cm
thick. You could see the herringbone pattern that the bricklayers used
in laying the bricks for the dome itself. By the time we got to the top
we were all hot and sweaty. Unfortunately Jane got stuck behind a very
hot and sweaty German guy who forgot to use his deodorant!! Nobody was
happier to get to the top and out into the fresh air than Jane.</p>
<p>The view from the top was amazing. We could see every direction, and
looking down on the top of this ancient city was really beautiful.</p>
<p>After three days without internet contact, which seemed like much longer
to all of us, we found a small Internet Cafe so we could check our email
before we headed back to the train station and our journey back to our
apartment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we were sidetracked along the way by more shopping. Jane
found a winter scarf, Kaia found T shirts for her friends back home, and
Josh found a pair of Italian Nikes. Unfortunately for Josh they did not
have the shoes in his size. In the meantime I found a soccer warmup set
that seemed like it would make nice lounge wear.</p>
<p>The rain at Il Lebbio continued while we were gone and when we returned
everything just felt damp. Jane made the comment that this was like
camping. All of our clothes just had a damp feeling to them. It would be
nice to have forced air heat or even air conditioning just to dry things
out in our apartment.</p>

			 <h1 id="the-leaning-tower-of-pizza">The Leaning Tower of Pizza</h1>
<p>This morning we got up early to head in to Pisa. We had tickets to climb
the leaning tower at 9:00, so we had to get under way in good time. That
meant getting up at 6:30 to be on the road in time to get to Pisa.</p>
<p>Parking in Pisa is difficult. Even at our early hour we had to drive
around for a while to find a parking spot.</p>
<p>The leaning tower really does lean. Quite a bit.</p>
<p>Climbing the tower was very interesting. At times it felt like we were
going up a really steep hill but at other times it felt like we were
almost going down hill while climbing the stairs. It was a very strange
feeling. The spiral stairways started out wide and got continually more
narrow as we ascended. By the time we got to the top the staircase was
barely wide enough for my shoulders.</p>
<p>Sine we finished our sight seeing pretty early we decided to find a
place to pick up some of the additional supplies we needed for our
apartment, such as beach towels and toilet paper. So I took a guess with
the GPS and we found a mall with a great big coop. This seems to be the
equivalent of a Target store matched with a Lunds. Lots of good fresh
food in the deli and meat areas and lots of fresh cheeses. In addition
to the usual stuff you find in Target. I was also able to find a new
pair of reading glasses for just 18 euros. I think its a much better
pair than I have found at home so maybe its not wasted effort.</p>
<p>Since we are in Tuscany here is a bit about our &lsquo;Villa.&rsquo; We have a
living room, a small eating area and a small kitchen. The kitchen has a
range and a toaster oven along with an assortment of small pots and
pans. If this is the size pan that most everyone uses over here it is no
wonder that the small french tops work just fine. The floors are all red
tile and the ceilings and columns are all brick. It feels very Tuscan
and it is quite charming.</p>
<p>We have two bedrooms and two bathrooms. The kids have a bedroom with
three single beds. Their bathroom is down the hall. Jane and I have a
king size bed along with our own bathroom. The water heater is located
in our bathroom and is an &lsquo;on demand&rsquo; kind of heater. That is whenever
you turn on hot water the water heater springs into action. The only
problem with this is it takes quite a while to get warm water, and our
water heater is a little finicky. Sometimes it heats and sometimes it
does not.</p>
<p>The manager is not here all the time so getting someone to fix the water
heater could be a bit tricky. Since I am complaining a bit I will say
that the weather has been rainy and damp, and our apartment is just as
damp as the outside. All our clothes feel damp, and we have been trying
to wash clothes for a couple of days and it is impossible to get them to
line dry in this weather. Finally I decided to light a fire in our
fireplace to help the clothes dry!</p>
<p>Tonight I cooked dinner in the apartment. After our interesting shopping
trip at the coop in Pisa I had the ingredients to make a nice Risotto.
Of course since we could not find chicken broth (brodo e pollo) I had to
make some stock from scratch. With no decent size frying pan I decided
to just throw the chicken into the sofrito and let it cook along with
the rice. That worked out fine, and of course everything came together
perfectly at the end when I added some of the nice Parmigianno Reggiano.
Along with some nice tuscan wine it was a very good meal. Josh seemed to
really like it as he had about four helpings. Maybe it was just nice for
him to get something he liked besides pizza!</p>

			 <h1 id="the-hill-towns-of-tuscany">The Hill Towns of Tuscany</h1>
<p>For our first full day in Tuscany we decided to check out some of the
hill towns. We went to Volterra and San Giamanginino, two of the ancient
Etruscan hill towns in Tuscany. The etruscans predated the Greeks and
were equally as advanced in art and science. It is really interesting to
look out at the horizon and you can see many little towns, each perched
on the top of one hill or another. The valleys are all full and planted
with vines and other crops.</p>
<p>The fact that the towns are all on tops of hills makes driving
challenging. You don&rsquo;t follow a nice straight road through the valleys,
but rather you go up one hill then down then up again, winding in and
around farms, villas, and the occasional castle.</p>
<p>Volterra is a beautiful city. It is much like what you would find in
other large european cities but has a much smaller feel. Although on
sunday afternoon it was still pretty crowded with tourists. We checked
out the Etruscan museum which had some interesting artifacts from
etruscan life along with hundreds of urns to hold the cremated ashes of
ancient etruscans.</p>
<p>We had a late lunch at one of Rick Steve&rsquo;s recommended restaurants.
When we walked in there was hardly anyone there but it was full when we
left.</p>
<p>After Volterra we drove to San Gimiangno which is another etruscan hill
town. It was also interesting but it was even more full of tourists than
Volterra. It was in SG that I realized that shopping appears to be a
very large part of the european vacation experience.</p>
<p>After our trip to the hill towns we decided to try dinner at one of the
restaurants recommended by the manager of Il Lebbio. We drove into town
and Tried Casa Masi, but it was full, so we continued on to Carpe Diem.
This was a restaurant that was attached to one of the hotels in
Montaione. They have a large outdoor seating area and and inside area
with a great view. We did not have a reservation so we ended up sitting
back from the view. The menu was nice and had several good looking wines
as well. We were all a bit tired of Pasta tonight so we tried a little
different menu. Crepes, Beef Chunks, Dory and Pork chunks.</p>
<p>The service was extremely slow even by Italian restaurant standards. But
at the conclusion of our meal the manager apologized and gave us a free
bottle of wine.</p>

<p>Our goal was to leave Venice about 1:00pm. So, we got up, had our
breakfast and headed over to visit the Doge&rsquo;s Palace.</p>
<p>After the palace we wandered back to our hotel and tried out one of the
recommended restaurants. The pizzeria around the corner in the Piazza.
Since they didn&rsquo;t start serving pizza until noon we found ourselves
with an extra 20 minutes for sipping pop and water. We made the mistake
of each ordering a pizza. I had the proscuitto, Josh had Margheritta,
and Jane and Kaia each had a cheese and basil combo. Josh and I only at
about half of ours, but Kaia ate her whole pizza!</p>
<p>It was a pretty drive to Tuscany. Many tunnels and in and out of rain.</p>
<p>For dinner tonight we took one of our managers recommendations and dined
at Il Cammieneto. While we were there we had a short conversation with a
group of Germans. When we told them we were from Iowa they smiled
brightly and said Ahhh, &ldquo;Big Potatoes!&rdquo;</p>

			 <h1 id="a-random-walk-through-venice">A Random Walk through Venice</h1>
<p>In Venice you can get lost very easily, but not for long. There are
signs everywhere point you toward to major landmarks, the Rialto Bridge
and St. Mark&rsquo;s Square.</p>
<p>After a small breakfast in our hotel we set out to take the tour of the
Grand Canal. From the St. Romana Vaporetto stop we listened to the
National Geographic tour of the canal as we headed around the S curve
toward St. Marks. It is hard to follow as all the buildings along the
canal are similar in many ways.</p>
<p>After we finished to tour we walked around St. Marks for a while. Josh
wanted to spend one euro to buy some corn to get the pigeons to perch on
his arms. I would not let him as they are so dirty and gross. We were
supposed to meet up with Ulring&rsquo;s outside their hotel we waited for a
while before leaving a note that we were headed to lunch. We just missed
them by a couple minutes.</p>
<p>We had a delicious lunch at one of the places recommended by our hotel
manager. Jane had ravioli, I had gnocchi, Josh had tortellini soup and
Kaia had spaghetti and meatballs. Jane and I also had a small pitcher of
prosecco, which turned out to be a sparkling wine. It was all very good,
but the cost was a surprising 63 euros. Each of our lunches on the menu
listed for about 7 euros but they charged more since we were having them
as our only course.</p>
<p>About halfway through lunch the Ulrings caught up with us and sat down
to eat as well. So we added dessert, which was very good. We split an
order of Tirimisu and an icream truffle. The truffle tasted like a layer
of angel food cake wrapped around a core of mocha ice cream.</p>
<p>After lunch we just started walking around parts of venice we had not
explored yet. We didn&rsquo;t know where we were going or what we were headed
toward but it was fun and we saw a lot of interesting shops and lots of
interesting people.</p>
<p>We made two stops for snacks during the afternoon. One for gelato and
one for pizza and a sit down. The pizza place was good and it was fairly
close to our hotel. It looked like rain so we stopped to pick up
umbrellas and rain gear. We asked if we could sit in the lobby of our
hotel and play cards but we were told that the tables were for breakfast
only and playing cards there was not possible. So we decided to walk
toward the Londra Palace. About halfway there it started to rain pretty
hard. But with our Umbrellas in hand we kept going.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Londra Palace we were all wet, but just minutes after
we sat down in the lobby the skies opened up and it POURED. So we
ordered a couple bottles of wine and played some five hundred. Jim and I
soundly beat the women three games to one, even though I had really
crappy cards again.</p>
<p>Over cards we looked at the really expensive menu for the hotel and
decided to go elsewhere unless it was really raining. Since it was
clearing up we headed out to find something. We ended up at what turned
out to be a really bad restaurant. Everything was very forgettable and
my crab must have come from a can. As we say, every vacation must have a
worst restaurant. We thought it was L&rsquo;Arche (the french version of an
Oasis on the tollway) but I think this was worse.</p>

			 <h1 id="road-trip-to-venice">Road Trip to Venice</h1>
<p>This was a long day of driving. First we went back down the mountain,
and then we moved a ways to the east and went back up and over the
mountain. The drive through the mountains was pretty. Lots of great long
bridges and many many tunnels. The nicest tunnels were not really
tunnels but rather covered roadways. This protects the cars from
landslides as well as snowfall.</p>
<p>Once we got into Italy we drove around the outside of Milano. The
traffic was &ldquo;intenso&rdquo; and the going was rather slow. About 1:00 we
were hungry enough that we decided to check out the next town for some
food. We saw a mall off to the side of the road so we checked it out. We
decided to have some pizza at a restaurant called &ldquo;Pizza Pause.&rdquo; This
was fine except that the young man waiting on us did not speak a word of
english. We nearly ended up with twice as much pizza as we wanted. In
the end it worked out fine and the pizza was pretty good.</p>
<p>It was pretty confusing getting into the parking lot in Venice called
Tronchetto. And once we got there we had to figure out where we were
going to get to the Vaporetto and where we were going to get our tickets
etc. It all worked out just fine and we ended up on the right Vaporetto
to our stop and San Ste. From there it was a tricky but short walk to
our hotel, the Hotel San Angelo.</p>
<p>The room is not too big, but it has two nice beds and a couch to sit on.
The bathroom has a toilet and Duvet along with the tub/shower. All the
lights in the room go out if you take the key out of the slot next to
the door. The Internet service does not work like it should. there is
some problem getting it to accept the security password for the
wireless.</p>
<p>After getting settled we decided to take a walk before we headed down to
meet Ulring&rsquo;s at their hotel. Venice has thousands and thousands of
little shops to look at and walk through. Of course now that we were in
Italy Josh was on full alert for a Totti soccer shirt. We saw a couple
of stalls selling soccer shirts and we managed to get by the first
couple. But, once we got to the Rialto bridge they had a store that was
selling genuine Soccer shirts and that was pretty much the end of it. 69
euros later Josh had a genuine italian soccer shirt. They print the name
and number on the shirt once it is chosen, so we had 20 minutes to kill.</p>
<p>We found a restaurant at the base of the Rialto bridge that had a nice
view of the water, so we sat down there for a beer, wine and soda. After
watching the people for 20 minutes Josh and I walked back to pick up his
shirt. As promised the shirt was ready and waiting for us and Josh was
one happy boy.</p>
<p>Just as we were crossing the top of the Rialto, we saw the Ulrings! Who
would have thought that we would just randomly find them here in the
city. They joined us for a little refreshment while we planned our move
for supper.</p>
<p>In addition to the recommendations from our hotel manager Jim and Nancy
had found an Indian restaurant and a Thai restaurant not too far from
our hotel. After some walking around we decided on the Indian restaurant
called - - We had an excellent meal. The kids all had Lashkis (sweet
yoghurt drinks) along with Naan (bread) and several different curries. I
had the chicken Vinaloo, Jane had Chicken Curry, Jim had a shrimp dish
and Nancy had Chicken Khorma. The chicken Khorma proved to be very
popular with the kids as well. Josh even said he liked the sauce on his
rice. We also had a variety of tandoori food as part of an appetizer
plate. It was all good, and the total for all nine of us was 190 euros.</p>
<p>After dinner we walked some more until we all decided to split up and
head for our hotels for the night. The plan is to meet the next day at
noon at the statue in front of Ulring&rsquo;s hotel, the Londra Palace.</p>

			 <h1 id="klein-matterhorn">Klein Matterhorn</h1>
<p>This morning we were greeted by a perfectly blue sky, without a single
cloud. We had two main choices for our main activity today: Take a
gondola up to the highest point where we could see the mountains of
Switzerland, France, and Italy, or take a train ride up the valley. We
decided on the first option.</p>
<p>The trip was actually composed of three gondola rides to get to the top.
And we were really truly at the top. We walked through a tunnel in the
paradise glacier and then took an elevator up a little bit to a platform
that was at 13,300 feet. From there we had a panoramic view of three
countries! There are not enough adjectives to describe the view from
this place. Not only could we see that Matterhorn but we had a crystal
clear view of Mont Blanc in France.</p>
<p>The Paradise glacier also features a set of tunnels that have been
constructed to display various kinds of ice sculpture. From the lift
area we had to hike down through the snow a bit to get to the entrance.
After the entrance we continued down on a path until we reached an area
where the tunnels leveled out. There were a few interesting sculptures
and some history on the glacier itself. Josh was a bit nervous about
going inside a glacier so he did not enjoy it as much as others.</p>
<p>This day&rsquo;s sights are really more about pictures than words. We all
agreed that it was cool to visit the Matterhorn and see the great
sights.</p>
<p>Back down in the village we dropped off our gear and extra layers back
at the hotel and then went to walk around the city of Zermatt. Josh had
been in search of sunglasses since the beginning of the trip so we hoped
to find something cheap for him. In the end we couldn&rsquo;t find any
sunglasses for less than 39 swiss francs so Josh got Jane&rsquo;s and Jane
got a new pair</p>
<p>We had a mid-afternoon snack of bratwurst (6sf) and ice cream (3 sf for
a single scoop). Along the way we ran across a couple of interesting
looking restaurants including an asian fusion restaurant and one that
Jane had read about called GramPi&rsquo;s. So we made a reservation for
8:00pm. After a bit more walking and looking we decided to head back to
the hotel to enjoy a rest in the pool.</p>
<p>We thought the pool had a jacuzzi but when we got there we found a
permanently attached sign that indicated that the jacuzzi was out of
order. So we just had to swim around and play frisbee for a while. The
water was not hot tub temperature but it was warm enough for swimming
and playing in comfortably.</p>
<p>We had a delicious dinner at GramPi&rsquo;s. Josh had a Hawaiian pizza, I had
Lasagne, Kaia had tortellini stuffed with cheese and basil in a basil
cream sauce. Jane had a pepperoni pizza. Cost was about 75 swiss francs.
We think Kaia had the best meal. Jane described the tortellini as
heavenly.</p>
<p>After dinner we went back to the hotel. The cheese fondue smell in the
lobby was really good. We decided to give Josh and Jane another chance
to beat Kaia and I at 500 but it was not to be. The score for vacation
so far is B,K 3 J,J 0!</p>
<p>We all went to bed about 10:00 hoping that we would get a good night
sleep, with a plan to have breakfast at 8 and leave for the banhoff at
9:00.</p>

			 <h1 id="driving-to-zermat">Driving to Zermat</h1>
<p>Breakfast this morning was continental style in the chateaux. Cereal,
cheese, bread, tea, yogurt. It was good. We could have ordered some
Saucisson or Jambon but we didn&rsquo;t. It was 14 euros each for breakfast.
After breakfast I called Dwight on Skype to let him know we were on our
way to Geneve. The plan is to meet him at the departures bridge at the
airport.</p>
<p>This morning it is still quite cool (7 C) but the sun is shining and the
clouds look like they might be breaking up. We are on the road at 8:30
headed for Geneve to have lunch with Dwight.</p>
<p>We met Dwight at the airport as planned and let him take over the
driving. Laurance was not able to join us as she was not feeling well.
Dwight said she had been having some bad morning sickness. He took us to
downtown Geneve and we walked around the old walled city and past the
giant fountain out in the lake. The fountain shoots a hundred feet into
the air and the wind makes it look like the sail on a boat as it comes
back down.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful lunch at a small restaurant in the old part of town
called Brasserie du Bourg-de-Four. Jane and I had Roesti with Jambon,
Ouefs (eggs), and fromage. It was delicious!! Kaia had some bowtie pasta
with parmesan cheese basil and ham. Josh had a ham and cheese omlette.
We were stuffed. Cost for lunch for 5 of us was 123.70 Swiss Francs.
Dwight reminded me that I did not need to leave a tip, that throughout
europe gratuities were built into the price. For exceptional service you
might round up and leave a couple extra euros. This means that a couple
of people have really gotten good tips from me along the way! While we
were eating lunch Laurance called to see if we wanted to stop by their
house for some dessert.</p>
<p>We had a very short visit and some desert with Dwight and Laurance and
then took off toward Zermatt. The drive was very scenic, especially the
last 30km. There were lots of waterfalls along the way and we began to
suspect that they had had snow here recently. We drove the car to Tasch
and parked it in the lot. Then we took a 20 minute train ride into the
town of Zermat. There are only electric carts in the town. A porter from
the hotel met us at the train station and drove us to the hotel.</p>
<p>The Park Hotel Beausite is spectacular, really, really spectacular! We
have the center suite with a little cupola that sticks above the rest of
the hotel with a 360 degree view of the mountains surrounding us. For
all the clouds and bad weather we have had the last two days we are in
luck today. All the clouds have dissipated and left us with a
spectacular view of the Matterhorn! We are all really excited about the
room and the wonderful views. I wish we could stay here several days
just to relax.</p>
<p>At dinner we learned that while we were visiting castles in the Loire
Valley, Zermatt was getting 15cm of fresh snow! In fact we learned that
many of the roads leading to Tasch were closed the day before, so we
were lucky we didn&rsquo;t try to come a day earlier! Today there is still
snow on many of the rooftops and in their gardens. Everything has
greened up and so the snow looks very clean and white against the spring
green.</p>
<p>Dinner at the hotel was a five course feast! It was barbecue night so
the menu went as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cream of vegetable soup</li>
<li>Fish course, they had a wide assortment of fresh fish to choose and
then they grill it for you. (Josh: John Dorry, Jane: Red Mullet,
Brad: Blue Marlin)</li>
<li>Salad course</li>
<li>meat course, again they had a huge assortment of meats beef, veal,
ostrich, wild boar, rabbit, pork, turkey, chicken, etc. to choose.</li>
<li>Cheese course</li>
<li>Desert course including Creme Caramel, A Citrus ice cream with
vodka, a fuit plate, or a banana split.</li>
</ol>
<p>Dinner took from 8:45 until almost 11:00. So we went back to the room,
and looked at the mountains some more. We played a round of 500 and then
took some long exposure pictures of the matterhorn. I think they turned
out pretty nice.</p>

			 <h1 id="castles">Castles</h1>
<p>This morning we left Paris for the Loire Valley. Our agenda includes two
castles to visit (Chambord and Chenenceaux) and an overnight stay at the
Chateau Malmont. Unlike Versailles, these castles are all considered to
be pleasure palaces, not palaces of governance. They were designed as
hunting lodges and entertainment centers for the royalty. Chambord was
absolutely huge. Construction was started by Francios I and continued by
Louis XIV (the Sun King) and was finished by the people of France for
Henri, the grandson of Charles X who never actually assumed the throne
or lived in the restored castle.</p>
<p>After touring the castle we bought some supplies that were locally made
and grown. This included some farmers cheese, Saucisson, and two loaves
of bread. I would have bought the Chevre but I was not sure what to do
with the moldy crust! I made sandwiches for everyone with my trusty
swiss army knife.</p>
<p>Chenenceaux was much smaller, it was built for the mistress of Henri but
taken back by his wife Catherine Medici when Henri died. It is built out
over the river Cher and has wonderful views. The best thing about
Chenenceaux was the kitchens!</p>
<p>After visiting the two castles we had another 3 hours to drive to
Chateaux Malmont where we stayed the night. We were really glad to have
the GPS this afternoon. From the freeway the Chateaux is really in the
middle of nowhere. I couldn&rsquo;t believe the little roads we were on were
even part of the map database! We were actually a little paniced when
the GPS ran out of batteries just after we got off the freeway. Luckily
josh had a partially used pair from his gameboy that had enough juice to
get us to the castle.</p>
<p>Malmont was also a hunting lodge and was much smaller than either castle
we visited earlier. It was realy nice inside and they had an indoor and
outdoor pool. Since the weather was quite cold (8 C) Josh took full
advantage of the indoor pool which was in a barrel vaulted room that
used to be the guard room. While Josh was in the pool, Kaia went for a 4
mile run and Jane rented a bike to follow behind her. The bike wasn&rsquo;t
very good so Jane got a tougher workout than Kaia!</p>
<p>Our suite was two bed rooms with big high ceilings, a WC and a bathroom.
Jane and I had a double bed and the kids had single beds.</p>
<p>The chateaux had a restaurant and a tavern. The restaurant was closed on
monday nights so we ate in the tavern, which was still quite formal. The
menu was three fixed price options based on how many and which courses
you had (17.50 - 24 euros). In fact the wine was cheaper than the meals.
That does not happen very often back home! The best quote of the day
came at dinner when we were sitting at the table and Josh just blurted
out: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a castle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jane, Kaia and I had the entree of Guinea Fowl in puff pastry, for the
main course Jane had Duck, and Josh, Kaia and I had the steak. Next up
was the cheese course with a variety of different cheeses and finally
desert which included a small layered cake that tasted like it had a
rhubarb middle. Along with the cake we each had a scoop of ice cream. We
were all trying to figure out what kind of ice cream it was so we tried
to ask the server, who spoke no english that we could tell. Kaia
deciphered that it was green apple ice cream.</p>
<p>The best part of the trip is... * Dad: Chenenceaux * Mom: Chenenceaux
and Chambord * Kaia: * Josh:</p>

			 <h1 id="rain-rain-go-away">Rain, Rain, go Away!</h1>
<p>The goals for today were... See Rodin&rsquo;s thinker in the Rodin gardin,
visit the Musee D&rsquo;Orsay, Visit the Versailles palace, and go up the
Eiffel tower. When we left the apartment it was nice although a bit
cool. We went to the marketplace again and got pain, gruyere fromage,
jambon, and cherries. We carried our breakfast thinking we would eat it
in the garden, but the garden was not public and we didn&rsquo;t want to
spend any time in the musee so we continued to the Orsay. We ate our
breakfast in front of the musee and then went in.</p>
<p>Once again the Rick Steve&rsquo;s commentaries were really good. I learned
more about realism, and impressionism than I ever knew before. Renoir,
Monet, Manet, Whistler, Rodin, it was really good. D&rsquo;Orsay used to be a
train station and the huge high arching ceiling is still preserved.</p>
<p>When we finished we noticed that it had started to rain, so we decided
to take the train straight out to Versailles. On the way, we passed the
statue of liberty, it looks just like the one in New York except it is
on the river here in France.</p>
<p>By the time we reached Versailles the weather was really cold and rainy.
We dashed across the street to get some food at McDonalds! The bacon on
the burgers was excellent! After lunch we tried to start walking but it
was so cold and rainy we turned right around and ran back into the mall.
We found a souvenir shop that had some sweatshirts, we bought 4
sweatshirts and 2 umbrellas. We have vowed that we will do better at
checking the weather forecast for the day in the future.</p>
<p>The Versailles palace was moderately interesting. Admission included an
audio tour but it was not nearly as interesting as the Rick Steves
guides. The rooms were interesting but the commentary most mostly about
who made the furniture when, and how many coats of laquer were applied.
Not so intersting unless you are a furniture maker. We did learn more
about the history of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI which was good. We stayed
through 2/3 of our tour but the line to get into the kings chambers in
the main hall was just too long to stand in during a cold rain so we
headed back and took the train back to town.</p>
<p>Once back in town we came to the apartment to rest and relax a bit.</p>
<p>Dinner tonight was at a Bistro down the road. Kaia and I had Chicken
Shishkebab with curry sauce, Jane had Duck with honey sauce, Josh had
Beef rib, which was a ribeye steak. Again it was all good. After dinner
we had a chocolate crepe and a crepe with sugar, almonds, cinnamon and
citron (lemon juice). A great desert.</p>
<p>So far the best part of the trip is.&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Kaia: Notre Dame, the food in general</li>
<li>Josh: Notre Dame except I had to pee really bad, and the crepes</li>
<li>Mom: Notre Dame</li>
<li>Dad: Musee D&rsquo;Orsay</li>
</ul>

<p>Yesterday morning we got up and walked down to the marketplace for
breakfast. Josh really wanted to buy a box of raspberries, so we did and
they were the best raspberries anybody had ever had. A little further
down the street we discovered a bakery. So we had a baguette, and
chocolate eclair, and a doughnut. All very fresh and good. Decorah
really needs a market area like this... (perhaps as part of the Kellog
grant proposal Brenda could do this)</p>
<p>After our little breakfast we walked, over the bridge to the grand
palace, down the road to the obelisk, onward to point zero, further
still to the Louvre. In the Louvre we walked. The Rick Steve&rsquo;s iPod
tour was really helpful and interesting.</p>
<p>Our family seems to have three speeds when going through a museum. Josh
and Mom lead the way, Dad is in the middle, and Kaia wants to savor
every work of art. In the Louvre we saw many classic greek and roman
works of art.</p>
<p>the Louvre was very interesting we saw the Mona Lisa of course, along
with many other famous works including Winged Victory, and the Venus
DiMilo. It was a good learning experience as we learned how the greek
artistry influenced the romans and other artists for many years to come.</p>
<p>Lunch was at the Cafe Beaux Arts, just a random place we picked as we
walked by. Josh had a cheeseburger, can you believe it? Kaia had Penne
with fresh basil and red sauce. Jane and I both had a hot ham and cheese
sandwich (Jambon avec Fromage) on toasted bread. The sandwich was
delicious. In keeping with French tradition we had a small glass of
wine. So far the idea that wine is cheaper than pop does not seem to be
true.</p>
<p>After lunch we continued walking, walking, walking down the the island
in the Seine. We went to Notre Dame cathedral, and the center point
which is right out front. The center point is the place that all other
distances in France are measured from. The cathedral was amazing. When
we got there the line to go in to the main cathedral was long so we went
around the corner and got in line to go up the tower. This turned out to
be a good decision, as the views were just great. In addition once at
the top you get to go into the bell tower itself to see a GIANT bell.
The radius at the bottom must be a good 10-12 feet and is so heavy you
can&rsquo;t really make it move back and forth by pushing on it. After the
large bell we were able to continue even farther up the bell tower for
even better views of the city. The weather was a little cloudy so the
Eiffel tower was in a haze in our picture.</p>
<p>When we got done with the tower tour the line was nothing to get into
the cathedral. So we went inside. Mass was in progress but tourists were
still allowed to wander around the perimeter. The rose window and the
organ were both beautiful.</p>
<p>By the time we finished the cathedral we were getting pretty tired, so
we decided to get a quick snack. We had a crepe chocolate to split. Very
very good. We continued down to the last little island called Isle St.
Louis. Here there were many nice shops and restaurants. On the way off
the island we stopped to watch a street performer for a while. He was an
acrobat and had a fun show.</p>
<p>By that time we were really tired and wanted to catch a boat ride back
up the river. But we couldn&rsquo;t seem to find the right one so we gave up
and walked, walked, walked back to the apartment. We were all very foot
sore by the time we made it to the apartment. I think none of us thought
we would walk that far and we were sorry we didn&rsquo;t have the pedometer
to keep track. We do know that we climbed 400 stairs in Notre Dame!</p>
<p>After a short rest, and some consulting of Rick Steve&rsquo;s we decided to
find dinner somewhere close by. Dinner was at La Arcade. We tried to get
in at several of Rick Steve&rsquo;s recommended places but they were all
quite busy. Josh had Duck, Kaia had Chevre in Phyllo Dough, I had rack
of Lamb, and Jane had Prawns.</p>

<p>A long day! We drove through some rain and thunder to get to the airport
in Cedar Rapids. Unfortunately it was also windy in Chicago which was a
bad omen for us. Our flight was delayed getting to CR and once we got
out to the end of the runway the dreaded ground stop announcement came.
Chicago was not allowing us to take off because they had no landing
slots. So we sat at the end of the runway for 45 minutes and one more
rain squall before we could finally take off.</p>
<p>As we began our descent into Chicago we watched helplessly as the time
ticked closer to 4:30, our scheduled departure time. Our only hope was
that our outbound flight was as delayed as everything else. This was not
to be. We got off the plane and ran across 2 concourses to get to our
gate only to find out the plane had left without us. We were told to go
to K6, the rebooking gate. The line there looked 2 hours long at least.
Jane tried to talk to the gate agent for the paris flight but they told
us there was not enough time to get our bags on the flight.</p>
<p>So there we were standing in line, using Kaia&rsquo;s cell phone to call the
rebooking number with a hold time of more than 28 minutes. Finally I was
able to flag down a manager (Shawn ) and I asked him why we couldn&rsquo;t
get on the Paris flight. When I explained that it looked like we were
going to miss an entire day of our vacation I think he felt sorry for
us. So, he looked on the computer and said we could fly to Frankfurt and
then back to Brussels. That flight left at 7:00. When he went to change
our booking he discovered that we had already been rebooked on a flight
to London connecting to Brussels. How we were ever supposed to discover
that is a huge mystery.</p>
<p>On the flight to London we were given the very back row of seats in the
777. This means we were even behind the bathrooms. The flight attendant
told us he would move us up because it was a very smelly place to sit.
He was a really nice guy and moved us to bulkhead seats in row 20, which
made for a pretty comfortable flight.</p>
<p>We had five hours in Heathrow to kill, so we tried to get some sleep in
the international lounge. Once on our plane to Brussels we were seated
in front of three obnoxious women (kind of like the nightmare version of
Bridget Jone&rsquo;s Diary)</p>
<p>Once in Brussels everything went very smoothly, all the luggage was
intact, we zipped through customs and didn&rsquo;t even have to wait at the
car rental counter. We had a little fun trying to get our first tank of
gas since I went to the Belgium card side of the gas station and none of
my credit cards would work. I finally learned that we need to go to the
other side of the gas station to fill up.</p>
<p>Now we are enroute to Paris! So far the GPS has been working and have
not gotten lost yet. We hid major rush hour traffic in Brussels and were
zooming along toward paris until just a moment ago when we hit a big
slowdown. Josh is enjoying our drive to Paris by looking at all the cars
he would like to drive.</p>
<p>As I write this in the car, we are all tired and hungry so are very much
looking forward to getting to our apartment and having an evening meal.</p>
<p>After Jane and I left the kids in the apartment and parked the car we
all went for a walk to check out the eiffel tower at night. Beautiful.</p>
<p>We had late night pizza at La Gourmandise. A little Pizza shop that
seated about 16 people max. Josh and I split a Pizza Margherita avec
chorizo and Jane and Kaia split the four fromage pizza. Very good.</p>
